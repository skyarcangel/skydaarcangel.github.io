Being one of two shotguns in the special tab, this expensive repeating shotgun has a slow fire rate, but a tighter spread and far lower damage falloff than other shotguns. Due to these features, and its 5 ammunition, this repeating shotgun packs a heavy punch.

Mechanics [ ]

Revolving Cylinder [ ]

The 1855 does not automatically index to a chambered round. If only partially loaded or unequipped with spent shells in the chambers, it may index to an empty chamber while firing, and dryfire, producing a clicking sound, and then rotating past the empty chamber. The cylinder can be spun into a random position by starting and then canceling a reload. The 1855 is the only primary weapon to behave in this manner, though the Peacekeeper , Lemat , Hammerless , and Aequitas Revolvers all share this mechanic.

Damage Falloff [ ]

Featuring the longest damage dropoff of any dedicated shotgun, the 1855 notably reaches much lower damages than the other shotguns, though it achieves comparable damage levels as it drops off. The extended falloff is likely due to the tight spread and high accuracy, which enable the Revolving Shotgun to effectively hit targets at longer ranges. Notably, this continuation of the dropoff chart gives singular 1855 pellets the lowest damage potential in the game, dealing 4.2 damage after traveling 220 studs.

Trivia [ ]

This revolver features a Root sidehammer mechanism. The cylinder clips through the top of the gun's frame in some positions. The 1855 Revolving Shotgun is capable of both killing in a single shot, and dealing the lowest possible damage in the game. It is currently the highest selling item in the game (due to the inability to sell auction items). Sneak peeks for this gun called it an "1855 Revolving Rifle". It was later revealed to be a Shotgun. The 1855 appears to be based off of a 10 gauge model, Colt also made the shotguns in 12 gauge, and similar carbines and rifles in varying ball calibers, with productions split between the USA and the UK.

1.1 Pros 1.2 Cons

General [ ]

The rifle has high damage (45 to the body, 72 to the head with a 1.6 multiplier), excellent accuracy and a 10-round magazine, which makes it effective both in PvP and against animals. The main advantages include high head damage, good accuracy , more damage towards animals , and a large magazine capacity, but the disadvantages include slow step-by-step reloading and inconvenience in close combat. This weapon is ideal for players who prefer accurate shooting at medium ranges, especially in defensive positions and shootouts, where you can make full use of its killing power and accuracy, although for maximum effectiveness it is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of reloading.

Pros [ ]

High damage High accuracy High bullet velocity Long dropoff range Low amount of damage dropoff High ammo capacity Additional damage against Animals Above average reload speed

Trivia [ ]

Real-world Lebels only had an 8-round tube capacity, but could hold 10 rounds total through having one in the chamber and another in the feeding elevator. In-game, the Lebel loads all 10 rounds in the tube magazine. The Lebel was one of the earliest military rifles to use smokeless powder, adopted by the French in 1887. The Winchester Rifle was one of the earliest commercial firearms to use smokeless powder, in 1895. The Lebel is the first Bolt Action rifle added in-game since the Lynx Bolt Action .

The Lebel Maxim features darker metals, and orange woods, compared to the duller brown and greys seen on the standard, but the short raised scope and Maxim silencer help to distinguish it further. In terms of mechanics, the gun is set apart by the forced first-person scoped view, a higher headshot multiplier, and overall higher body damage, allowing it to kill a player with two shots to the body. It also produces a far quieter sound when firing.

Trivia [ ]

The 1886 Lebel Maxim is the second scoped repeating rifle, after the Spitfire Revolving Sniper . While the Silenced Hammerless featured many sneak peeks, the silenced Lebel was kept fairly quiet, save a short appearance throughout the Hitman trailer. In real life, the Maxim would silence the Lebel, however it would not silence the Silenced Hammerless. Also in real life, placing ten rounds into a Lebel would require fully loading the eight round magazine, cycling a round into the chamber, cycling the next round into the elevator, and then loading an additional two rounds. In-game, all ten are loaded into the magazine.

The fort, appears very similar to Fort Henry and Fort Spencer . Featuring the same architecture, the wood appears darker, and significantly disheveled. Crimson arrows stick out of the palisades, and large holes have been blown into the sentry towers. Ladders lean against the walls, and the gates have been blasted off, lying in the dust below. A tattered flag of surrender flies at half mast, and the normal mill and supplier shop found in forts are nowhere to be seen.

Trivia [ ]

Kaz Co. Firearms crates can be seen stacked around the flag. Why they're there, and what they contain, is a mystery. The arrows embedded into the walls have red fletching, unlike the white ones seen on normal arrows, or green seen on Poisoned Arrows . Players cannot use, purchase, or interact with these arrows. The flag flies at half mast, and is white for surrender or an uncontrolled fort. The flag itself has also been partially torn down. During the Sinner's Moon event , Skeletons took up residence within the Fort. Originally, six undead skeletons inhabited the Fort, however half of them were later moved to the Forest of Bones area. The condition of this fort compared to the other two present in the game, and the multiple arrows still in the walls of the fort, point to the conclusion that a fight between the native Washte Tribe and settlers occurred and led to the demise of the defenders. Giving the resemblance of Tribal Forest to the Big Valley region of West Elizabeth in RDR2, the Ruined Fort is most likely based on Fort Riggs Holding Camp, as both were army forts now in a dilapidated and neglected state that were the sites of altercations between the U.S. Army and Native Americans.

Type

Location

Inhabitants

The area offers many great places to mine and hunt, serving as a useful base of operations. The overall appearance is of a "tribal" settlement with teepees and various themed furnishings scattered around.
The Abandoned Tribal Camp is made of a large circle of teepees and wigwams, with a Giant Sequoia standing in the center. Surrounding the area are some fortifications, including a guard tower, and sharpened logs to keep out unwanted guests. The back of the camp is protected by giant rock outcrops.

Additionally, the surrounding forest is a great place for hunting and mining, populated by many Deer and Bears and housing a few Mining Locations . The Tribal Camp is also an excellent place to travel to during a thunderstorm , as Thunderstruck Logs are likely to spawn in and around Tribal Forest.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Tribal Camp is based off of First Nations villages. During Halloween events , players often hunted the Wendigo by attacking it from on top of the teepees. The game map still says Tribal Camp. The camp is a faction territory . Upon successful capture, the territory will be designated as The Native Camp. The Camp was a neutral spawn location called "Tribal Village" before Silver Hills was added and replaced it as the tribal forest spawn point.


--- Abandoned_Tribal_CampHistory ---

The Abandoned Tribal Camp has existed in some form throughout most of The Wild West's history.

The Admiral's Axegonne , also known as the Admiral's Axegun , or just the Axegun ,  is a unique muzzle-loading caplock pistol with an axe head fixed around the barrel near the muzzle.

It can be used as a gun, melee weapon, and tool for Woodcutting , matching the Tier 3 Axe and Frozen Axe in cutting power, but with lower damage and a slightly slower swing speed. It has the second highest starting bid at auction, starting at $100,000 .

The Axegonne, added in Sneaky Shane's Mini-Update , was recovered by Pedro Gilbert from a sunken Swedish Navy vessel, and then sold to Kaz Co. Firearms to be auctioned . According to the item's description, it was "designed by the Swedish Navy for boarding actions." With the ability to kill players, Bison , Deer , and Horses in a single head shot, the Axegonne trades its capacity for damage; it can only fire once before it needs to be reloaded. The body damage of the bullet is high enough to kill a player after they have been hit by the axe at least once, and vice-versa, though this must be done quickly, before the player regenerates health.

The Admiral's Axegonne can only be fired while Aimed . When not aimed with Q or right click, left clicking instead swings the axe. The Axegonne may also be fired out of a sprint by holding an aim button, and then pressing fire, though the sprint is still interrupted to play the aiming animation and firing slow.

The axe functions almost identically to a Tier 3 Axe, though swings slightly slower and has a shorter reach. It can chop down any harvestable tree or cactus, and deals 3% per hit to thunderstruck variants.

Additionally, perks that increase "Axe Damage" obtained from the Logging progression skills also increases the melee damage of the Axegonne.

Trivia [ ]

Unlike the wood Axes, the Axegonne's head and blade are thin and narrow, designed for combat. Similar axeguns were used in Sweden, Poland, Germany, and surrounding areas from the 1700s, typically with flintlock mechanisms. The Axegonne is the first gun to have an animation for bullets being rammed into the bore. The loading levers seen on other cap and ball firearms (such as the Navy Revolver and Paterson Navy ) are not used. It is also the first gun to function as both melee and ranged. The Axegonne is the only axe that can be used while running. The Axegonne has a straight stock all the way down, due to primarily being an axe. Almost every other firearm in The Wild West has either a pistol grip or a full buttstock. The Axegonne has a unique holstered location, hanging off the player's lower back rather than the waist like the rest of the sidearms. It has a 6% chance to appear in the Auction House . The Axegonne is aimed from roughly the hip. Aiming it in first person lowers your point of view to the torso to allow the sights to be used. The Axegonne has a sell price of $35,000 and can only be sold in the Black Market . The Axegone, Kukri , and Jezail Musket are the only auction items that were never droppable. Out of all guns in the game, the Axegonne is historically the oldest. The first Admiral's Axegonne sold for $13,001,000.

Trivia [ ]

Aequitas is a Roman concept, relating to justice, conformity, and fairness, an inspired the concept of equity in law. It was also depicted as a goddess, as part of some of the Roman emperors' campaigns. The Aequitas Revolver, similar to the Spitfire Revolving Sniper , is a fictional gun. The Aequitas Revolvers are currently the only clip-reloading revolvers. The Aequitas Revolver was added in the 3.4 Update, however was officially kept a secret until June 20th, 2021. Prior to the reveal of the Aequitas, many players suspected that it was an engraved Peacekeeper or Paterson Navy . Many players still refer to it as such. The Aequitas was shown holstered in some early sneak peeks of the Auction Update, notably in the video showcasing the Explosive Arrows . Similar to Auction weapons, the Aequitas Revolver has a serial number. The number is based on order granted, instead of order purchased at auction. Like other unique weapons, the Aequitas cannot be discarded.

--- Aequitas_RevolverHistory ---

A Starboard Studios staff-only revolver, the Aequitas Revolver has undergone minimal changes, with the most striking being a palette swap in 2023.

Originally releasing secretly alongside the version 3.4 Auction Update, the Aequitas had a 3x headshot multiplier, and a base body damage of 35. This maximum headshot of 105 damage was lowered with a 2.6x multiplier and a  one damage reduction for body damage with the Auction rebalance after only two days, reaching a maximum of 88 headshot damage and 34 body damage.

The color palette was originally reminiscent of the Paterson Navy and a specific Kukri Machete , though with a yellower "gold", and no purplish sections as seen on the frame and sheath respectively. The cylinder, cylinder access pin, buttplate, lanyard ring, and switches on the sides of the gun would be recolored to match the hammer, sights, trigger, and engravings, while the grips were changed from white to a reddish brown. The engravings around the gun's name were also changed, with a neon blue box enclosing the frame engraving.

Changelog

23/05/2021: The Aequitas Revolver was added to the game.

25/05/2021: Headshot multiplier was reduced from 3x to 2.6x, damage reduced to 34.

25/12/2021: The Frozen Aequitas was added to the game.

--- Aim ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 3.9.3 .

Aiming is a game mechanic used by all weapons in The Wild West. Aim determines where projectiles and attacks will go, and reflects Accuracy. The better players are at aiming in-game, the better their weapon skill shall be.

Contents

1 Guns 2 Throwables and Melee Weapons 3 Bows 4 Options 4.1 Aim Sensitivity 4.2 Gun Crosshair Type 5 Trivia

4.1 Aim Sensitivity 4.2 Gun Crosshair Type

Guns [ ]

Most primaries and sidearms use the same crosshairs for aiming, though they don't all mean the same thing. This will go with the average reticle, and then list exceptions afterwards. There are two settings for this crosshair, 3 Lines, and 4 Lines. 3 Lines is the classic crosshair we all know and love, 4 Lines adds an additional line, making a "+" shape. Shotguns feature a special Shotgun Crosshair, featuring 4 Lines, making an almost circular shape that shows the expected spread of the pellets. It functions the same as the other gun crosshairs, but cannot be changed.

These reticles loosen and tighten based on accuracy. Players can do a number of things to modify this accuracy. Standing still, aiming with Right Click or Q, holding Left Shift to focus, and being solidly on the ground will increase the stability of the camera, which will help with aim. Fanning and Horse speed both lower accuracy, and loosen the crosshairs. Throwable, melee, and bow do not change accuracy under these conditions.

Exceptions:

The Sharps Rifle and Spitfire Revolving Sniper have scopes that zoom in several times, and have a large black crosshair over the end. While using these scopes, bullet drop and recoil become more noticeable due to the zoom. Holding Shift does not zoom in, as it does with other guns, instead holding the gun still, at the cost of stamina. Sharps and Spitfire Scope. The Hartford Rifle , Spitfire, and Martini Henry have iron sights. While they also have the crosshairs in third person, they can only be fired while performing the aim action, making the crosshairs useful only for quick scoping, as they do not appear when aiming, and cannot be hipfired or fired without aiming. The Hartford's tang sights. The Martini Henry's iron sights. The Spitfire's iron sights on top of the scope. The Admiral's Axegonne is both a Melee and Gun. It uses the standard gun crosshair, and has no crosshair in first person. Shooting without aiming will swing the axe, activating a melee attack. Similar to the iron sight and scoped rifles, Aim must be held when shoot is pressed to fire, however this will then put the gun into the firing animation if it wasn't already. Unlike the iron sight and scoped rifles, first person is not forced by this, and it can be done while sprinting.

Sharps and Spitfire Scope.

Fan-the-Hammer:

With most single-action revolvers, and a few lever action guns, accuracy can be sacrificed for firing speed. Firing these guns without holding an Aim key will activate fanning. These guns can also be fanned while aiming, by holding Aim as well as [F]. This does not increase fanning accuracy, but may help aim in first person. Notably, the Model3 , Volcanic Pistol , and Volcanic Rifle have far higher fanned accuracy than other guns.

Throwables and Melee Weapons [ ]

A Tomahawk, BlowDart or Lasso being charged. Knives, Axes, and Pickaxes do not feature the bar.

A Throwable charging.

Throwables and Melee weapons have a single dot in the center of the screen, showing the direction the weapon is being swung or thrown. In third-person, this reticle is far less responsive when using a knife or axe , only working accurately with throwables such as Dynamite , Smoke Bombs , Tomahawks , Snowball , and Blow Darts . The knives and axes have a preset swing in third-person, which can only be angled slightly. In first-person, the reticle can be used to change where stabs and swings will be directed, allowing the knives to stab above and below the user, while the axes can be angled slightly, for greater precision. The Tomahawks, Snowballs, and Candy Canes feature the same aiming system, with an added bar underneath. When throw is held, the bar fills. When the bar is completely white, the tomahawk will deal maximum damage, however if throw is released at any point before filling the bar, it will deal normal damage. The Lasso uses the same charging feature as the Tomahawk, however glows red when filled, and then depletes after 3 seconds of being red. Blow Guns and Snowballs also use the charging system, needing to be loaded, and then charged up to fire. They can only be fired when at full charge.

The Admiral's Axegonne does not feature this reticle, using the standard gun crosshair. In first person, it has no reticle.

Bows [ ]

The Horse Bow's Reticle.

Bows take a slightly different approach with the reticle, featuring a far more accurate crosshair with four lines and a large ring around the outside forming the reticle, which shows charge strength and accuracy. While players charge their bow, two indicators will move along the reticle's circle, which represent charge strength. The white section of the circle represents any time that the bow can be fired. While the bow can be fired at weaker charges, its arrow velocity is greatly reduced and its damage is lower. Once the indicators reach the top, they will remain there for a moment before beginning to shake and drift apart. At this point, accuracy will decrease drastically and the player's screen will shake. During the bow's charge and while the indicators are in the center, accuracy will be perfect. Bows do not lose accuracy when jumping, moving, or on horseback.

A visual guide to charging.

Options [ ]

Two settings can be used to impact aim-related mechanics.

Aim Sensitivity [ ]

Added with the console release, Aim Sensitivity is a slider that appears at the top of the menu. Defaulting to 1.0 in the middle, this can be adjusted to change how sensitive aiming and the camera are to user input. It ranges from 0.01 to 2.

Gun Crosshair Type [ ]

Two buttons are shown under this option, allowing users to choose between 3 Line and 4 Line Crosshairs. This setting impacts most rifles and revolvers, but does not apply to shotguns or bows, and effectively does not matter for snipers. If 4 Line is selected, an extra vertical line appears, mirroring the central line above from the 3 Line crosshair.

Trivia [ ]

The Throwable and Melee crosshair appears the first time players go into First Person View [V], and disappears after an item has been equipped. Aiming in first person lines up the gun's sights with the center of the screen, allowing players to use them to aim. Earlier guns have less accurate sights, and may be harder to use. Target Dummies feature a bullseye on the chest. Arrows will stick into them, and bullet holes will appear on higher graphics settings. Bows used to have a gun crosshair, before being given a melee.

1 Hunting Tips and Behaviors 2 Locations 3 Drops 4 Gallery 5 Trivia

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

Gators may be difficult to hunt due to their high health and small heads. A Gator's land speed is slower than most players, so running away to escape one should work, unless the chase enters water, where Gators are at their best. Using a high surface like a log or a hill will keep a gator from biting you. A few headshots with powerful guns like the Mule Shotgun , 1855 Revolving Shotgun or Sharps Rifle are always a solid strategy, though a high capacity automatic weapon like the Harmonica Rifle or Guycot Chain Set can also make quick work of a Gator, as long as they aren't too close. This also works with Fannable Guns . Some players use the Longbow , which can kill a Gator in two fully-charged headshots, but it will leave the player vulnerable while charging. The Horse Bow doesn't have this problem, but will take a third shot after two headshots to kill a Gator. Jumping on the many logs around the swamp or getting height is a good way to protect yourself from gator attacks

Albino Gators spawn very rarely, but are easily picked out from their environment due to their bright colors. They require a Gator spawn to appear, so killing normal Gators makes it more likely that an Albino Gator will appear. Albino Gators have similar drop patterns to normal Gators, meaning the pelt will always be guaranteed.

Locations [ ]

Gators can only be found in the Swamp and the Water Cavern . Albino Gators have a chance of spawning in place of any normal Gator.

Drops [ ]

(Cooking Animal Meat with a Campfire adds 50% more to the sell price.)

Trivia [ ]

Albino Gator Pelts may also be obtained from T3 Chests while Treasure Hunting . An Albinism (or achromasia) is a genetic disorder causing a pale white appearance, due to the fact melanin is not formed which leaves tissues without hues. The red eyes come from blood vessels visible in the eyes. Gators are the only animal with additional non-seasonal non-legendary variants, and the only animal with variants of this type that may spawn in place of the standard animal. Albino Gators were added in the 2022 Halloween update .

Behavior [ ]

Armed with Laser Cannons , Aliens stick around in small groups of three near the location where their UFO crashed. They stay close to each other, and will fire at any players or non-Alien NPCs they come across. They have a chance of dropping their Laser Cannons when killed, and will eventually despawn, even when engaged in combat. If an equal amount of players attempt to attack them, the Aliens will separate to fight the players. Because Aliens are fairly inaccurate on their own, splitting them up is an effective strategy to fight them.

Spawning [ ]

During storms, lightning has a chance of striking a cruising UFO. If struck, electricity arcs throughout the UFO, before tipping it forward and plummeting to the ground in a large explosion, destroying the ship and damaging or killing any players in a close vicinity. 1-3 Aliens will spawn in the collision after fleeing the wreck.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Flying Saucers first appeared during the Sinner's Moon event in 2021. The Aliens did not spawn and could not be seen; instead, they lowered Laser Cannons down from their UFOs for players to use. During Frozen Days, also in 2021, Elves wielded Laser Cannons. The Aliens use the Classic Alien hat, which cannot be obtained or worn in-game. However, another Alien hat exists for community staff. Aliens aren't very accurate at longer ranges, which means players can use Sharps Rifles or Spitfires to safely chip away at the health of Aliens.

Location

Inhabitants

Alpine Meadows is a mountainous floral region located just beside Glacial Hollow , near Pinewood Hills .

The area is known for its lush, colorful flowers, with no trees located in the area. The gentle hills and high elevation give it a peaceful atmosphere, distinct from the harsher terrain surrounding it. A Bison can occasionally be found grazing in the region, and several ore deposits can be mined, though they are sparse.

A notable feature of Alpine Meadows is the relocated grave of Arthur Morgan, previously found in Pinewood Hills, more closely resembling Arthur Morgan’s actual grave from Red Dead Redemption 2.

There are no NPCs , shops, or quests associated with Alpine Meadows, and its remote location makes it primarily a destination for exploration , hunting , or sightseeing.

Ancient Descent

Type

Location

Inhabitants

During the Event , two glowing pillars emblazoned with the Greek letters delta, sigma, and omega rose out of Howling Peak 's waterfall, above the Submerged Train Wreck . The massive boulder blocking the descent was also removed, allowing players to enter the dingy tunnel. Bones and rocks line the tunnel walls, as well as three candlelit signs, each warning cowboys of the dangers to come. As they approach the Gates of Hell, more terrain and flora from the Forest of Bones can be seen.

The Gates have "ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE" glowing above them, and 30 Piles of Bones could be fed to the gates to open them. The Gates could only be opened from one side and greeted the player who opened them with a message that read, "Welcome to Hell, [Display Name] " . Attempting to open the Gates from the inside results in an error message that reads something along the lines of "No turning back now, sinners may never leave." The descent continues, though noticeably more underworldly and without any more warnings. It lets out at the front gates of the Forest.

After the event ended, the pillars vanished, the signs were removed, and attempting to give bones to the gates results in the message, "The gate appears to be rusted shut."

Signs (Removed) [ ]

Trivia [ ]

As the player goes deeper into the Ancient Descent, their marker on the map will appear in a black void somewhere north of the Highlands . The Descent was added sometime in Version 3.4 , but it was inaccessible due to a huge boulder blocking the cave mouth. Two Silver ores and two Coal ores can be found within the Descent, allowing players to pick up some ore on their way to the Forest of Bones. They still remain there today. Despite saying "No turning back now" , if someone on the outside opens the Gates, players from the inside can leave through them, back to The Wild West . Similar gates and inscriptions dot the Forest, the most noticeable one from the previous event reading, "SINNERS REMAIN FOREVER" . The description inscribed above the gate is a reference to the epic poem Divine Comedy by Italian poet Dante. In it, the same description is written above the gates to Hell.

Spawn Locations

In The Wild West , a wide variety of wildlife can be found populating the wilderness, and some Animals can even be found in towns. These animals all share several similar features, though differ in behavior, temperament, locations, and drops. This is a quick guide to animals that can (and some that cannot) be encountered in The Wild West . Click on links or icons for more information about specific animals.

Animal Mechanics [ ]

The game offers a variety of animals that spawn all over the map near certain spots. Animals have random tempers, and may run when approached, or be extremely territorial, though they generally have a normal behavior for their type. Deer are the most likely to run, while Bears and Gators will almost always attack any nearby player. If attacked by a wild animal, it's best to remain ragdolled, and wait to regain health, or for the animal to leave, as animals will not attack ragdolled players.

Some animals have a chance to spawn as a Legendary Variant, and can drop up to $4,650 worth of loot. Gators have a Legendary and an Albino variant. Albino Gators are normal gators, however have a unique coloration and a pelt worth an additional $670. Bears may be struck by lightning during Thunderstorms, and become Scorched. Scorched Bears drop Cooked Animal Meat, and may also drop a pelt worth an additional $1,050.

After being killed, the animal's body despawns after around 30 seconds. A new animal spawns roughly 50 to 60 seconds after the original was killed.

Animals spawn in a small radius around their spawn locations. The size of this radius is approximately 1-1.5 Camp Tents , but varies by spawn.

Animal Spawn Locations [ ]

All animal spawns (as of 3.7.6) overlayed on the map. Bears over the Tribal Camp , all Gerald , and the Pinewood Hills Gator spawn in underground caves . Animals spawn very close to these locations, but they no longer spawn in the exact same spot every time! Keep your eyes peeled while hunting!

Legendary Animals can spawn replacing any of their "normal" variants. Albino Gators can spawn replacing any "normal" Gator, though there is no Legendary Albino Gator. Unlike other Legendary and unique variants, Scorched Bears replace existing alive Bears.

Hunting [ ]

In The Wild West, there are many ways to earn money, one of which being hunting animals. Hunting is one of the most efficient, fun, and profitable ways to make money - but can be risky and dangerous. If you are not careful. Most animals are aggressive, and can kill players in just a couple of attacks. Items dropped by animals are also dropped by players on death. Once you have hunted enough game, you can then take their drops to any store (excluding Hunt and Trade ) to sell.

It is recommended to purchase powerful weapons and a Camp Fire before attempting to hunt.

2023: Was rarely dropped by the Wendigo, in groups of 1-3.

Trivia [ ]

The Hartford , Sharps , Martini Henry , Spitfire , Admiral's Axegonne and a fully-charged shot from the Bow , Tomahawk or Frozen Horn Bow can kill a deer with one body shot. However, only the Sharps, Spitfire, and Admiral's Axegonne can kill a Bison with a single headshot. During the 2020 Halloween Event , Bears, Gators, and Bison would drop one Animal Bone on death, along with the raw meat. If its recoil can be controlled, the Spitfire can kill all animals with a single burst at long ranges. Legendary Animals have different drops, but the drops sell for the same total amount. Legendary Bison Pelts are twice as valuable as Legendary Bear and Gator items to offset the lower amount of items dropped. Polar Bear hunting was so profitable that the developers had to cut the pelt price almost in half and remove the safe hills in their enclosure. The sell price was lowered even further in Version 3.4 , for unknown reasons. During the 2021 Christmas Event the value was raised to $175. Dynamite and TNT can deal heavy damage to animals, but will not normally kill them in a single explosion. Explosive Arrows stick to animals, dealing massive damage. Tomahawks and Candy Cane Throwing Axes are unreliable for use against animals. Despite their high damage, they become single-use items, as they will be sent to your Mailbox as soon as the animal is killed in most cases. Prior to version 3.6.30, Legendary Animals would be announced in chat when they spawned. Deer have no Legendary variant, likely due to their low health and lack of attack.

Some animals have a chance to spawn as a Legendary Variant, and can drop up to $4,650 worth of loot. Gators have a Legendary and an Albino variant. Albino Gators are normal gators, however have a unique coloration and a pelt worth an additional $670. Bears may be struck by lightning during Thunderstorms, and become Scorched. Scorched Bears drop Cooked Animal Meat, and may also drop a pelt worth an additional $1,050.

After being killed, the animal's body despawns after around 30 seconds. A new animal spawns roughly 50 to 60 seconds after the original was killed.

Animals spawn in a small radius around their spawn locations. The size of this radius is approximately 1-1.5 Camp Tents , but varies by spawn.

Animal Spawn Locations [ ]

All animal spawns (as of 3.7.6) overlayed on the map. Bears over the Tribal Camp , all Gerald , and the Pinewood Hills Gator spawn in underground caves . Animals spawn very close to these locations, but they no longer spawn in the exact same spot every time! Keep your eyes peeled while hunting!

Legendary Animals can spawn replacing any of their "normal" variants. Albino Gators can spawn replacing any "normal" Gator, though there is no Legendary Albino Gator. Unlike other Legendary and unique variants, Scorched Bears replace existing alive Bears.

Hunting [ ]

In The Wild West, there are many ways to earn money, one of which being hunting animals. Hunting is one of the most efficient, fun, and profitable ways to make money - but can be risky and dangerous. If you are not careful. Most animals are aggressive, and can kill players in just a couple of attacks. Items dropped by animals are also dropped by players on death. Once you have hunted enough game, you can then take their drops to any store (excluding Hunt and Trade ) to sell.

It is recommended to purchase powerful weapons and a Camp Fire before attempting to hunt.

Trivia [ ]

The Hartford , Sharps , Martini Henry , Spitfire , Admiral's Axegonne and a fully-charged shot from the Bow , Tomahawk or Frozen Horn Bow can kill a deer with one body shot. However, only the Sharps, Spitfire, and Admiral's Axegonne can kill a Bison with a single headshot. During the 2020 Halloween Event , Bears, Gators, and Bison would drop one Animal Bone on death, along with the raw meat. If its recoil can be controlled, the Spitfire can kill all animals with a single burst at long ranges. Legendary Animals have different drops, but the drops sell for the same total amount. Legendary Bison Pelts are twice as valuable as Legendary Bear and Gator items to offset the lower amount of items dropped. Polar Bear hunting was so profitable that the developers had to cut the pelt price almost in half and remove the safe hills in their enclosure. The sell price was lowered even further in Version 3.4 , for unknown reasons. During the 2021 Christmas Event the value was raised to $175. Dynamite and TNT can deal heavy damage to animals, but will not normally kill them in a single explosion. Explosive Arrows stick to animals, dealing massive damage. Tomahawks and Candy Cane Throwing Axes are unreliable for use against animals. Despite their high damage, they become single-use items, as they will be sent to your Mailbox as soon as the animal is killed in most cases. Prior to version 3.6.30, Legendary Animals would be announced in chat when they spawned. Deer have no Legendary variant, likely due to their low health and lack of attack.

The Armored Train Car was removed with the Progression Update. The update changelog teased the addition of a new armored car or armored train in the future. The rest of this page will discus the robbery as it was before Version 4.0 . [ ]

The Armored Train Car had a distinct appearance from other Train cars, being large, gray, and plated in metal.

This rare car could be found randomly when a train spawned in, and only appeared on Armored Trains. Should a daring Outlaw attempt a heist , a varying amount of gold bars awaited them inside the car. It was the rarest train type and was the fastest as well.

Route [ ]

The armored train will always spawn in the Bear Paw Valley train tunnel and travel toward Bronze City . After stopping there, it loops around past Callahan's Manor and passes through Bronze. It then heads to Bear Paw Valley and goes south though Dead Man's Drop .

Once the train reaches Copper Gulch Mine , it will stop briefly. After waiting for around 10 seconds, the train departs from the station and leaves the map through the Ashburn Prison Camp tunnel.

If robbed between Copper Gulch and the Prison Camp, 10 gold bars will be found inside the vault instead of 4.

Equipment Needed [ ]

At least one piece of Dynamite , but it's recommended to get two. Alternatively, Explosive Arrows can work. A fast horse , though this is optional. Fort Henry can be used as a closer dropoff point for the loot, if captured before the heist.

Procedure [ ]

There is a very small window of time to get maximum profit from robbing the armored car. With good positioning and careful timing, it is possible to quickly loot the armored car, and then the rest of the train. The best dropoff location for the loot is Fort Henry, as it is the closest to the train and tunnel where the car will be stopped, though Windmill Camp can also be used in a pinch.

Robbing the car is one of the trickier heists, and it can be quite dangerous. After boarding the train, players must locate the side of the armored car that has a Dynamite icon floating above it. This wall must be blown up, though this can be difficult with Dynamite, as the sticks tend to bounce off of the train. For an easier time, players can fire an Explosive Arrow into the wooden bed of the car, next to the door. After blowing open the car, players can then enter the car and the server will be alerted to the robbery. Upon entry, a vault door will need to be lockpicked. After successfully picking the lock, the crooks gains access to a munitions chamber, full of explosives.

Here, players can hold [E] to set off a dynamite charge, free of cost. This takes around 15 seconds, and is very difficult to pull off if attempting to get maximum payout after Copper Gulch. For a faster entry, the munitions can be set off within five seconds with another thrown stick of Dynamite, or an Explosive Arrow to the wall. After blowing up the explosives with their method of choice, the train will screech to a halt, the Armored Car having a hole blasted in the roof. Players will have access to the gold vault, where they can take four or ten gold bars, depending on when they rob the train. Once the train has been stopped, players should get the gold and leave fast, as every player in the server will be able to see the stopped train's location.

If players choose to rob after it has passed Copper Gulch Mine, they will need two pieces of Dynamite or Explosive Arrows to open it before it reaches the tunnel and despawns. Robbing after the mine has also the danger of being close to Bronze City, and players will find themselves with three or more players after them in a full server. This greater risk comes with far greater reward, an additional 6 gold bars. Do not pick the safes for cash before stopping the train, especially if going for maximum profit, and instead only take them if you have time after getting the gold. Riding to Fort Henry is then the fastest and safest way to collect your payment, but any dropoff zone can be used.

The words "UNITED STATES ARMY", "FRAGILE CARGO", and "KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE" are printed in gold on the side of the train car, along with the numbers "3122010". It is unknown what purpose these numbers serve. One of the boxes inside the vault of the Armored Car displays, "RedTrain's Hopes and Dreams", a reference to one of the developers.

--- Armored_Train_Car_RobberyHistory ---

The Armored Train Car Robbery is very old. In its time of existence, it has seen changes, with some being significant, and others not so much.

In the beginning, the train car was much bigger. It also displayed the United States Government as the "U.S.M.R.R", translating to United States Military Rail Road . To break in, the player had to climb a ladder to the roof and blow open a hatch. Then, they would climb down in a ladder and open the vault door, which would lead them into a room full of cargo, where they would light a fuse to blow it up. After that, they would then navigate to the room filled with gold.

The only change after this was that the car was previously at the back of the train as the caboose, but is now in the middle. No mechanical changes were involved in this.

Ashburn Prison Camp is a heavily guarded facility featuring two watchtowers fully staffed with Ashburn Guards , along with defensive platforms lining the top of the outer walls. A green supervisor’s tent is located near the entrance, and a stable-like structure stands to the right. Although players cannot escape or break out of the prison, Ashburn Guards will open fire on any outlaws who come too close to the camp. Guards spawn within the barracks and frequently patrol the area, adding to the camp's sense of activity and security. While most of the barracks buildings are inaccessible, one room can be entered by players. All guards wear the same uniform, though their weapons may vary. They have 150 health and are extremely dangerous.

Mechanics [ ]

Outlaws that are arrested and or plead guilty by the Mayor with Menace status are sent to Ashburn Prison, serving a sentence of 300 seconds, or 5 minutes.

While serving a sentence here: players are given protection, lose access to their tools and weapons, are chained to one of the many poles surrounding the interior of the prison, and are given a Tier 1 Pickaxe to mine the Coal deposits inside the prison. Each Coal deposit mined earns the prisoner $2 , as well as a 10 second sentence reduction. Non-jailed players cannot mine the Coal deposits found in the yard, and will be met with the message "You cannot mine this ore!".

If the player leaves the game, the player's sentence will be reset to 300 seconds upon rejoining.

Escape Strategies [ ]

Players can jump over the wall by hopping onto the pole where the chains are attached. However, these chains will remain attached to the player's legs, causing them to ragdoll if they go too far beyond the walls.

If you play on ROBLOX Player, you can [Alt+Tab] out of the game while holding [LMB] to automatically hold down left click until it is pressed again, allowing you to mine coal indefinitely until going back to ROBLOX while in another window.

Players can get themselves killed from a variety of ways. They can repeatedly climb onto the prison walls and jump to slowly kill themselves while in prison. Animals will also be provoked to attack the player, if they somehow enter the prison—however they have trouble entering through the large doors.

A Hitman can accept hits on incarcerated players; however, the target cannot be harmed until their sentence ends.

Dying while jailed resets the 300 second counter, and allows the Mayor (if the role is filled) to hold another trial, allowing for a chance of escape.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The minimum time a player can spend as a prisoner is 114 seconds. Ashburn Prison Camp was formerly known as the "Prison Camp" and later "Fort Tyler"; named after tyridge77 's forename. Ashburn Train Station was formulated as a passageway to enter Santa's Workshop during the North Pole event . Trains do not stop at the Ashburn Prison Train Station. Previously, camp items could be used to glitch into the barracks. Theoretically, if a player is constantly killed by Animals or fall damage before being released, they will stay in Ashburn indefinitely.

Ashburn Station was a small train station adjacent to Ashburn Prison Camp . The station was removed in the Progression update .

If a player were on a train that entered the tunnel, they would be teleported onto the front of the platform. Trains did not stop here.

The small benches on the platform appeared to be made of two logs split in half. The origin tree of these logs seems to be from an unknown tree with dark brown wood.

Inhabitants

The building is also the Mayor 's primary residency and contains their hiring post. The structure itself contains multiple features exclusive to the mayor, which include the courthouse, the criminal bounty pardon board, town funds board and the bell.

At the front entrance is the Mayor post, with a balcony on the floor above serving as cover for the front porch. The first floor is merely a simple living room with a few tables and chairs; along with some red carpets.

The first floor features a check-in room at the front entrance, welcoming visitors into the hotel. Beyond it lies a main hall with two staircases curving upward to the second floor. At the center of the hall is a door leading directly into the courtroom.

The courtroom can be found on the first floor. It features multiple benches for spectators and a chair for the Outlaw ; who is cuffed onto the table and unable to leave it until the trial ends. There is a table for the Mayor, where they can decide the case. Although the Outlaw cannot leave the chair and escape, before the Progression Update (4.0) , the player could use the ragdoll button , to "escape" the chair and reach the stairs for the second floor.

The second floor serves as the Mayor's parlor, with multiple rooms, with one of them having  plush chairs and a couch, together with tea tables to the sides. At the left of the main-room, a board with the names of Outlaws and the crimes they have committed can be found. The mayor can use this board to pardon players, removing their bounty and restoring their status to Citizen. There are also two separate bedrooms located at the back of the main room, one of which serves as the sleeping quarters for the secretary NPCs during nighttime hours.

Players can climb onto the building's roof by using the ladder at the back of the Auburn Hall to get up. Players can hide on the roof and snipe players with guns like the Sharps Rifle and the Spitfire Revolving Sniper .

The Auburn Hall from 2020 seen from above.

History [ ]

Auburn Hall was added in the August Update , along with the Bronze City rework and Jobs . It had more paintings when it was first added, but besides losing some of them, it has not changed much since. The clock on the building's steeple lacks hands, making it more of a decoration than a working clock. This was not always the case; in older versions, the clock face was present on the building. The Auburn Hall was given Christmas decorations during the Christmas 2021 Frozen Days and Christmas 2020 North Pole events . They were removed when the events ended.

Trivia [ ]

On top of Auburn Hall can be seen flying the so-called " Cowpens flag ", an early unofficial version of the United States flag which, some say, was seen used during the Battle of Cowpens in 1781 and of unclear history or provenience. The Mayor can actually ring the bell situated on the roof by "pulling" a rope (interacting with it using [E] )  on the third floor that comes down from the ceiling. Once pulled once, the rope will automatically go up and down regardless of where the Mayor or other players are. In the best conditions, the bell's sound can be easily heard throughout all of Bronze City and its vicinities. Auburn Hall has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) .

The Auction House is a store found in Howling Peak . Here, players can bid on a wide variety of items, ranging from exotic and powerful guns to beautiful instruments. However, a hefty price tag comes with these rare items, so players must be sure to bring lots of money when visiting, or they may not be able to purchase the item of their desire.

The building's interior features a mounted Wendigo head with glowing red eyes, an auctioneer NPC, multiple glass cases displaying rare auction weapons, a Harpsichord , rows of seats and a mailbox just outside the back exit. It also has several tall vases and some crates of firearms. The Auction House is also connected to the Grizzly Saloon by a small doorway behind the couches. You can exit directly through a small side door, offering a view of the chilly mountain outside.

Auctioning [ ]

To auction, players must walk up to the NPC and open the Auction House menu. For a limited time, they have the ability to bid an amount of money for an item (see image below). The Top Bidder is the player who holds the highest bid. To place a new bid, someone must bid at least $1,000 more than the Top Bidder, so in the case of the sample Lancaster Auction, at least $126,420. Whichever player has the highest bid after the remaining time (in this case, 6 minutes and 1 second), receives the item. If someone places a bid higher than the player's current one or they do not win, their money is reimbursed in full.

Originally, all weapons obtainable from the auction could be seen in glass display cases, except for the Lancaster Pistol . Later additions (the Kukri Machete and Admiral's Axegonne ) also do not appear on display. The Spitfire Revolving Sniper remained on display while being off auction. As of 4.0.1, it is back on auction, with a card reading "LIMITED STOCK FOUND." The Paterson Navy is identified as the "Paterson Six" in its display case. The Kukri was sneak-peeked on one of the Auction House's shelves, however does not appear there in-game. No Instruments are on display, though the Harpsichord is there, and can be played. It cannot be bid on. The Auction House contains the fourth piano variant instrument added to the game, the Harpsichord, the other three being the Steam Organ , the Pump Organ , and the Piano . When not in use, it plays Les Cyclopes . There are many crates littered around the Auction House labeled " Kaz Co. Firearms ", the owners of the Auction House, and some of the Gun Stores . It is unknown who manufactured the auction instruments. Some of the auction weapons are manufactured by Kaz Co., while others, like the Kukri, Axegonne, and Jezail are imported and distributed by them.

The Auction House is a unique shop found in Howling Peak .

It specializes in the sale of the exotic, the expensive, and the eccentric, supplying and importing items for Kaz Co. Firearms . Items include powerful and weird guns, a variety of instruments, trading tickets, and even a machete.

As part of Howling Peak's northern building, it can be entered through the Grizzly Saloon 's main floor, and has a back exit which leads out to the Whispering Summit Ice Ravines and Bear Paw Valley . A Mailbox can be accessed at the back exit for any items sent there while participating in auctions. The main entrance features a red fabric canopy that drapes down to the floor, and is illuminated by several small electric lights.

The front and back entrances are in line with each other, allowing players to walk straight through. The interior has a unique decorative style compared to the rest of Howling Peak, with red and purple fabrics draped all around the room, and large red curtains hiding some of the spare crates stored at the back of the room. Various shelves can be seen, covered in multicolored glass bottles. Several couches sit in front of the Auctioneer, who stands near the back of the room on a raised platform. Display cases showing various wares from the Auction can also be found around the room. The Auction House is separated from the Grizzly Saloon by more of the ragged but colourful fabrics.

A Wendigo mask with glowing red eyes can be seen hanging above the raised section.

Harpsichord [ ]

The Auction House is also the only location to have a Harpsichord , which plays an arrangement of Jean-Phillipe Rameau's Les Cyclopes when not in use. Players may also use the Harpsichord to play MIDI files, or as a standard Virtual Piano instrument.

Display Cases [ ]

Originally, all weapons obtainable from the auction could be seen in glass display cases, except for the Lancaster Pistol . Later additions (the Kukri Machete and Admiral's Axegonne ) also do not appear on display.

The Spitfire Revolving Sniper remains on display despite being either off auction, or so rare that it hasn't been up since before Halloween 2022 . The Paterson Navy is identified as the "Paterson Six" in its display case. The Jezail Musket in the display case. Identified as "New Stock". The Kukri was sneak-peeked on one of the Auction House's shelves; however, it does not appear there in-game. No Instruments are on display, though the Harpsichord is there, and can be played. It cannot be bid on. The Black Market Key also could was not displayed, nor was a Trade Ticket added when it was remodeled.

Kaz Co. Firearms [ ]

Crates marked Kaz Co. can be found around the Auction House, stacked up outside, and tucked behind curtains inside. According to Sneaky Shane , Kaz Co. owns the Auction House, and uses it to distribute various manufactured and imported goods. The Kukri Machetes and the Admiral's Axegonne are examples of imported goods, while guns like the Spitfire Revolving Sniper may have been manufactured in limited amounts by the company. The makers of the instruments have not been confirmed in-game.

History [ ]

The Auction House occupies what was originally the Howling Peak Guns and Ammo shop's space. When it was the Gun shop, it was filled with shelves holding a variety of equipment, the majority of which was not sold in the Gun Shop. Bedrolls, Tents, Tomahawks , Frying Pans, a Sharps Rifle , a Mule Shotgun , and boxes of ammo could be found on the shelves, while animal skins were hung around the room. It was separated from the Howling Peak Saloon by a simple white tarp. Sneak peeks for the Volcanic Pistol and Rifle were set there. Guns and Ammo was moved next door, to the opposite side of the Grizzly Saloon when the Auction House was set up.

Sneak Peeks of the Auction House originally showed a podium in the place of the Auctioneer.

1 How it Works 2 User Interface 3 Bidding 4 Winning and Losing 5 Auction Items and Rotation 6 Gallery

How it Works [ ]

Throughout the day, rare items are put up for Auction. Players bid against each other and the highest bidder gets the item. There is a cooldown between each bid. If you don't win you get your cash back.

User Interface [ ]

The Auction House UI is split into two sections. The right column shows a list of every item currently up for Auction. A clock and a countdown show how much time remains for each item to be bid on. If enough items are up for Auction, the list can be scrolled through. The right column shows the remaining time, the model of the item rotating, along with its name, serial, and description, and then the Current Highest Bid amount, Roblox avatar of the Top Bidder, and their Roblox username. Underneath the current bidding information, the Place New Bid button sits, which will be replaced with a countdown when on cooldown.

Bidding [ ]

Auctions are "global", meaning that every server accesses the same Auction House. Server connections and lag may be an issue considering every open server needs to be synchronized. A good rule of thumb is to allow five to ten seconds after any interaction in the auction UI, just in case another user made a similar action which may overwrite actions taken at the same time but delayed by lag. Every player in the game is bidding on the same items. Players manually enter their bid amount in a popup after clicking "Place New Bid". Bids cannot be retracted once sent. Bids must increase by a minimum of $1,000 between bids, though there is no upper limit. Bidding adds additional time to the auction, typically between 10 and 20 seconds.  After placing a bid, users will be unable to bid on the same item for 60 seconds.

Winning and Losing [ ]

Any money lost, either to lag or to being outbid, will be returned to the player when they check the Auction House UI again. Note that due to lag, this may take multiple tries or even rejoining the game to recover the cash. Players who win an auction will receive a "You Won" popup upon opening the Auction House UI again. Accepting the item will send it to the Backpack if a space is open, otherwise the item will be sent to the Mailbox . Bids will be "lost" when another player bids a higher amount.

Auction Items and Rotation [ ]

Items come up every fairly often, typically with four items up for auction at any given time. When an item comes up for auction, it has a chance of being any item that is in rotation. Currently, the only item that was not in rotation was the Spitfire Revolving Sniper , but now it is back to the Auction House. There are 24 possible items that can appear randomly.

Bonnie Parker of Bonnie and Clyde actually wielded a sawed off  Auto 5 called "Whippet". However, Bonnie used the Remington Model 11 (produced under license by Remington for the American market, as the Auto 5 was produced by FN Herstal for the European market) and featured a longer barrel and a shorter buttstock instead of a pistol grip unlike the game version.

The Admiral's Axegonne , also known as the Admiral's Axegun , or just the Axegun ,  is a unique muzzle-loading caplock pistol with an axe head fixed around the barrel near the muzzle.

It can be used as a gun, melee weapon, and tool for Woodcutting , matching the Tier 3 Axe and Frozen Axe in cutting power, but with lower damage and a slightly slower swing speed. It has the second highest starting bid at auction, starting at $100,000 .

The Axegonne, added in Sneaky Shane's Mini-Update , was recovered by Pedro Gilbert from a sunken Swedish Navy vessel, and then sold to Kaz Co. Firearms to be auctioned . According to the item's description, it was "designed by the Swedish Navy for boarding actions." With the ability to kill players, Bison , Deer , and Horses in a single head shot, the Axegonne trades its capacity for damage; it can only fire once before it needs to be reloaded. The body damage of the bullet is high enough to kill a player after they have been hit by the axe at least once, and vice-versa, though this must be done quickly, before the player regenerates health.

Mechanics [ ]

The Admiral's Axegonne can only be fired while Aimed . When not aimed with Q or right click, left clicking instead swings the axe. The Axegonne may also be fired out of a sprint by holding an aim button, and then pressing fire, though the sprint is still interrupted to play the aiming animation and firing slow.

The axe functions almost identically to a Tier 3 Axe, though swings slightly slower and has a shorter reach. It can chop down any harvestable tree or cactus, and deals 3% per hit to thunderstruck variants.

Additionally, perks that increase "Axe Damage" obtained from the Logging progression skills also increases the melee damage of the Axegonne.

Trivia [ ]

Unlike the wood Axes, the Axegonne's head and blade are thin and narrow, designed for combat. Similar axeguns were used in Sweden, Poland, Germany, and surrounding areas from the 1700s, typically with flintlock mechanisms. The Axegonne is the first gun to have an animation for bullets being rammed into the bore. The loading levers seen on other cap and ball firearms (such as the Navy Revolver and Paterson Navy ) are not used. It is also the first gun to function as both melee and ranged. The Axegonne is the only axe that can be used while running. The Axegonne has a straight stock all the way down, due to primarily being an axe. Almost every other firearm in The Wild West has either a pistol grip or a full buttstock. The Axegonne has a unique holstered location, hanging off the player's lower back rather than the waist like the rest of the sidearms. It has a 6% chance to appear in the Auction House . The Axegonne is aimed from roughly the hip. Aiming it in first person lowers your point of view to the torso to allow the sights to be used. The Axegonne has a sell price of $35,000 and can only be sold in the Black Market . The Axegone, Kukri , and Jezail Musket are the only auction items that were never droppable. Out of all guns in the game, the Axegonne is historically the oldest. The first Admiral's Axegonne sold for $13,001,000.

This Axe deals 25 damage to players, same as the Basic Axe, but has a slightly longer reach, and is noticeably stronger when logging, felling trees at a much faster rate. Snags can be chopped down in three swings, and up to fifty for thunderstrucks, assuming it can harvest the base variant. With longer range and a bigger blade, it's slightly more effective than the Basic Axe for combat, but still deals low damage.

Prior to the 4.0 update, the Quality Axe (at that time called the Tier 3 Axe) dealt 45 damage and was a formidable weapon, but due to the introduction of more powerful axes and axe damage buffs that can be obtained through the logging skill tree, this axe's damage was adjusted to be the same as its Reinforced and Basic counterparts, 25.

The Frozen Axe was an event reward from Christmas 2021 , obtainable for 15 "Nice Tokens" in Santa's Gift Shop .

Setting it apart from the Quality Axe is the model, appearing far sharper and much more weathered, with the head made of chipped ice. The handle is also damaged, with a cloth grip wrapped around it. In addition, it emits ice and snow particles from the blade. It functions identically to the Quality Axe while woodcutting but has a different swing noise and leaves icy trails in its wake. It is better for combat, dealing 45 damage (previously 50 before being reduced in update 4.0). It cannot be swung while sprinting; however, after the swing has started, you can sprint while the axe is still in motion. During early versions of the event, it was obtained from Krampus' Contraband for 15 "Naughty Tokens" instead. It could also be sold for $3150, but this was removed before the event ended.

It swings slower than the other Tier 3 Axes, but can cut everything that they can. It is notably shorter, and deals less damage in combat, however it also packs a strong punch, capable of dealing up to 120 damage with a headshot from the caplock pistol that makes up the handle.

Materials [ ]

Logs [ ]

Axes aren't required to obtain logs (and wooden planks), but they are the most efficient way to do so, as Fort Suppliers overcharge for their logs. Logs are needed to cut into wooden planks, which can then be used to protect or raid Forts. Logs and wooden planks will likely get more use when Building releases.

Wooden Planks [ ]

Trees can be chopped down to obtain logs, which can then be taken to Sawmills to be cut into planks. These planks can currently be used to build ladders, gates, and repair broken gates.

Cactus Juice [ ]

Cacti can be chopped down to obtain cactus juice, a consumable item that provides a short healing boost to the user.

Thunderstruck Logs [ ]

In order to acquire the rare loot found in Thunderstruck Trees, the use of Axes is necessary. However, Axes can only successfully fell Thunderstruck Trees if they are capable of cutting down the regular variant of the tree. When using a Tier 1 Axe, each swing will only inflict 1% damage to a Thunderstruck Tree, provided it can effectively chop down the tree. Similarly, a Tier 2 Axe will deal 2% damage, and a Tier 3 Axe will deal 3% damage under the same circumstances.

Thunderstruck Cactus Juice [ ]

Just like the Thunderstruck Trees, Axes are required to obtain the rare loot that drops from Thunderstruck Cacti. Axes are only capable of cutting down Thunderstruck Cacti if they are capable of doing so to the normal variant of the Cactus. A Tier 1 Axe cannot chop down any Cactus, a Tier 2 Axe will deal 2%, and a Tier 3 Axe will deal 3% per swing.

Combat [ ]

When any Axe is swung, the hitbox of the Axe remains active throughout its entire animation. This means that anything the axe touches during its swing and pull-back will be hit. Axes cannot be swung while the sprint key is held, however swinging and then sprinting can be done. Due to the head hitbox being active during the full swing, players may spin or move while in a swing to hit multiple targets, though trees, players, and wildlife may only be hurt once each by a single swing.

The Frozen Axe is the most viable for combat, featuring a longer handle, larger head, and significantly more attack damage than the other axes, allowing it to kill in two swings. Unfortunately, axes swing far slower than knives , and are a good deal heavier. Their only advantage is the longer reach. Axes also can be used to clip through walls further and more accurately than knives or guns .

To counter the axes' limited movement while fighting, a Mule , Mustang , American Standardbred , or other sufficiently short horse can be ridden on to allow strikes with the axe while still remaining mobile. Taller horses will put the axes' swing above most players and animals.

The first swing of an axe takes roughly 0.6 seconds, each swing after taking about 0.5 seconds in each direction, with short halts when fully extended in front of and behind the player.

Trivia [ ]

The Tier 3 Axe and Frozen Axe are some of the strongest melee weapons, the Frozen Axe only matched for damage by the Kukri Machete . Tiers 1 and 2 appear to be Mauls, or "Splitting Axes", while Tier 3 is a "Bearded Axe". The Frozen Axe is a far more imposing Bearded Axe, and appears to draw inspiration from pop-culture Viking battle axes. It is considered a sport by many to start a duel and "joust" by using horses and an axe. This is now done with the Skinwalker Spear , due to it's range being more like a real lance. There is a method of cutting down trees faster by using two axes where one tries to chop down a tree while alternating between two axes about twice per second so that they can get more chops in a smaller amount of time. It is best performed using a Frozen Axe and a Tier 3 Axe.

Trivia [ ]

The old water tower was smaller and did not have a ladder up to the top. It was also far less detailed and did not have a pump house. The windmills seen in-game convert the rotation of the blades to a vertical pumping motion to pull water out of underground sources. The pump house was added in the Accidental Update, along with the remodeled water tower, cargo platform, a Sheffield Handcar , and some railroad changes. The water tower has a door in its side that's currently locked shut, with no handle. A sign on the front door identifies the Pump House as belonging to Bronze Peak. A window on the left side of the pumphouse appears to be fogged up, as the interior of the house is obscured. The Pump House and Water Tower were moved slightly left in Version 4.0 to where the


--- Backpack ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

The Backpack (previously "Inventory") is a core feature that allows players to store items , and can be accessed by pressing "B" .

Up to 30 slots can be filled in the backpack. Players can equip a compatible hotbar item by clicking on it. Once an item is equipped, its icon will have a green holstered symbol at its bottom-right corner. If the Backpack UI is ever in the way, players can click and drag it to wherever they want. Stacked items such as Dynamite , Bandages , and Wooden Planks also only count as one slot in the backpack; even though some stacked items can range from a low number all the way to 10. This can technically be used to exceed the 30 item limit.

Certain items will drop from the backpack upon death. "Drop on death items" are marked as such when hovering over them. Almost all weapons and tools do not drop, and will not be lost when players die or reset.

Filtering [ ]

The Backpack has 5 sortable tabs. They divide stored items into types, and hide items not in that type when selected.

ALL - Represented by the text "ALL", every item in the backpack will be visible while selected. Weapons - Represented by a revolver, primary and sidearm weapons will be displayed here. Weapons that fit into the tool slots, as well as special ammunition, will also appear here. Tools - Represented by a pickaxe, all tools, instruments, and similar fun items that fit in the tool slots will be displayed here, including the Flare Gun and its ammunition. Loot - Represented by a bag of cash, items that are typically sold for cash or are otherwise consumable will appear here. Most of these items will drop on death. Camp - Represented by a house, items that can be placed will be displayed here. Most of these are camp items.

Selling [ ]

Vendors and shops can sell most loot automatically with [F]. Using [E] to open a shop menu will also bring up the backpack, where items can be sold individually, including items that cannot be sold in bulk. These include guns, tools, thunderstruck logs, and cactus juice.

Trading and Mailbox [ ]

As long as the Trade Ticket is in a player's backpack, they can open the Black Market 's doors. Items can only be traded out of the backpack with the trading tables. If a trade would cause a backpack to overflow, the extra items are sent to the Mailbox . Items also go to the mailbox if there is no room in the backpack while receiving items from the Auction House , or sometimes if lost due to a bug.

New Items [ ]

When an item is picked up or purchased, a notification count will appear over the Backpack UI on the side bar. This red notification with a white number shows how many new items are in the backpack. Inside the backpack UI, they will be marked by a glistening white reflection running across them. Hovering over the item will remove the effect and the notification.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

All items are ranked in tiers. Visit the Item Tiers page for more info. There was previously a glitch where players could use Tomahawks to break the backpack item limit, allowing them to hold an infinite amount. This glitch was patched in the 3.3 Update. If a Developer spawns an item into a player's inventory while it is full, an extra space gets created instead of that item being sent to the Mailbox . A new backpack icon has been teased.

Spawn Locations

The Baked Bear is a very rare variant of the Bear that occurs when a Bear gets cooked by lightning during a Thunderstorm .

These Bears are easily recognizable by their glowing blue eyes and the yellow-orange cracks crisscrossing their fur. The fur itself is darker than a normal Grizzly, though lighter than some Legendary Bear's pelts. Additionally, black smoke and bright blue bolts of electricity arc around the Bear, which acts as a light source , illuminating the area around it similar to a Torch .

Meat dropped by the Baked Bear is already cooked, and the rare Scorched Pelt dropped is worth $1,200. While not as valuable as a Thunderstruck Log or Cactus , it is able to spawn in any server, regardless of player count. Despite releasing long before the event, the Baked Bear is part of the Undead Legends event,and was supposed to have been added early. The name "Baked Bear" was not officially revealed until Undead Legends' changelog in-game.

Mechanics [ ]

Every four minutes there is a 5% chance a Thunderstorm will occur. Rain does not always mean a storm, and a storm does not always mean a thunderstorm. During thunderstorms, lightning can find a variety of targets. Every choppable variant of tree and cactus can be struck, even inside of zones where they cannot be felled, and ones outside the boundaries of the map. Lightning may hit random open spaces. It may also hit players, though it is unknown if this is just the random space happening to be occupied by a player at the time. Lightning acts as an explosion, dealing heavy damage. Lightning may also hit a Bear, in what appears to be a separate event from random strikes or Tree and Cacti strikes.

Only standard Grizzly Bears can be struck and cooked. No Baked Legendary, Zombie, or Polar Bears have been seen, and likely do not exist. When a Bear is struck, it is replaced by a Baked Bear. The lightning that strikes the Bear does not appear to damage other Bears, Animals, or Players, and will only change a single target. Baked Bears eventually despawn if not killed, similar to Thunderstruck Logs and Cacti. If they have the same lifetime, players have roughly 15 minutes to find and kill the Bear before it vanishes.

Unlike Thunderstruck Trees or Cacti, Baked Bears do not have an announcement in chat when they spawn.

One way for players to find these bears is for them to patrol Tribal Forest , Bear Paw Valley , and Pinewood Hills while there's a thunderstorm as that is the only way they can spawn. While doing so they may encounter a Thunderstruck Tree or Cactus as they, too, can only spawn in thunderstorms, and can give a hefty cash bonus. Another option players can employ is to gather a bunch of bears and then stand on something while it's thundering. That way players can safely wait for the bear to be struck.

Trivia [ ]

The smoke effect is similar to that of the Cursed Volcanic Pistol . Unlike other Bear variants, Baked Bears spawn as normal Grizzly Bears, and change type when specific conditions are met. All other variants spawn as their type. Despite being "Baked", the Bear drops Cooked Animal Meat and a Scorched Pelt. Many players refer to them as T-Bears, Thunder Bears, or Thunderstruck Bears due to the visual and spawning similarities to Trees and Cacti. Unlike other "Thunderstruck" items, the Scorched Pelt has a reduced sell price when obtained in a private server, and will be marked with (VIP). Developer Tyridge77 posted on Discord "Man idk how anyone’s getting these we made it so dang rare that we didn’t even announce it because we figured no one would 😂" on October 16th, 2023. [ 1 ] Lightning Strike-rate was greatly increased during Undead Legends. The Baked Bear is the same size as a Legendary Bear . (When both are compared to the normal Bear size.)

One of the entrances to the Desert Mine is nearby, located just behind the large fire. Shaded by Coastal Redwoods , Western Red Cedars, and a Giant Sequoia, the camp consists of a circle of two types of tents , with most being slightly smaller than those available to players . However, one of the tents is significantly larger and uses metal supports instead of wooden ones, similar to the tents found outside of Howling Peak . In addition, there are two wooden tables, each with a lantern, and a bonfire that lights up the camp and creates a cozy atmosphere.

Eight hostile Bandit NPCs spawn here and will attack both Outlaws and Citizens. However, if you capture the territory, the NPCs will no longer attack you unless you attack them first.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Bandit Hideout was added in Version 3.1 . This location is the perfect place to set up some tents and make a camp with some friends. It also has a mine situated directly beneath it, allowing for easy access to players who want to get a bit of money. During the Sinner's Moon event, several Skeletons were seen camping here, armed with Winchesters and Peacekeepers . During the Frozen Days event, an Evil Snowmen with a Marlin Pump Shotgun was stationed here. This was later changed to a Winchester Rifle. The camp is a faction territory. Prior to version 3.8, the hideout had no name and was commonly called the "Desert Mine Camp" by the community. It is only known today by the territory capture message. This is one of the three territories with hostile NPCs that will only become passive once you claim the territory.

It uses the Virtual Piano interface to translate keyboard inputs into banjo notes. Worn neck-up on the back while in the Hotbar , it can be used as a cosmetic. For players not wishing to play their music by hand, the Bands feature can be used instead, allowing players to autoplay MIDI files, and sync to other musicians.

Abilities [ ]

A Barkeep's primary responsibility is feeding their player and NPC customers with Meals and Rootbeer . By equipping their special Role Meal and Role Rootbeer items (found in item slot 7 and 8), and by holding [E] on a player or willing NPC, the Barkeep is able to offer them a Meal or Rootbeer, depending on which item is equipped. Each sale the Barkeep will earn them $25 .

When a player or NPC is seated at a table or the bar within all Saloons, any Meal or Rootbeer that is either sold to them or equipped will appear on the table in front of them. When finished, an Empty Plate or Empty Bottle will be left behind. These items can be picked up by Barkeeps and, when thrown away by them, will earn them $14 .

Avoid picking up the food of another player or NPC if it's not finished, because this will give a bounty to whoever does it.

NPC Interactions [ ]

NPCs often visit and hang around the bars in each town. If an NPC wants a meal, they will wave their hand and an icon of the meal or drink will appear above their head. Just like interacting with a player, using the Role Meal or Role Rootbeer item on an NPC will give them the respective item.

If many NPCs are visiting the bar, be sure to keep the bar clean! Dirt accumulates often (every 5 minutes, after it is swept), and should be swept up with a Broom . NPCs will comment on the state of the bar if it is a mess or if there are many empty plates around, and may refuse to buy food until the bar is cleaner.

Trivia [ ]

The 4.0 Update changelog hints at Barkeeps and Cooking being skills in the future. A bell near the Barkeep hiring posts can be used by players to "Ask for Service", sending a message to all Barkeeps nearby. If nobody is nearby, a message will appear to the player saying: "There are no Barkeeps nearby!" A Barkeep cannot request Barkeep service from themselves. Attempting to do so will tell them that there's no Barkeep nearby. Other nearby Barkeeps may be notified, however. Sneaky Shane was a Barkeep, but he stayed in the Kitchen of the Bronze City Saloon. He used to wave at players upon first seeing them, and turn to watch them, but he could not be interacted with. He was relocated to the top floor of the Bronze City Gun Store in the Treasure Hunt Update (3.7) where he now sells Clue Scrolls. The Barkeep role has a 30 second cooldown to claim.

4.1 Polar Bear 4.2 Legendary Bear 4.3 Zombie Bear 4.4 Baked Bear

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

Bears have very high health, fast regeneration, and deal a lot of damage, so approach them with extreme caution. Most sidearms and rifles are unable to deal enough damage to take down a bear in a direct confrontation, even at medium ranges. Groups of players armed with shotguns, especially the Mule or 1855 may get results, as well as hunting rifles like the Sharps or Hartford Rifle . The Spitfire Revolving Sniper is the safest way to take down a Bear, as it is able to deal heavy damage fast at long range. Bolder players are known to use strong fannable revolvers, especially the Lemat , Lochke , and Paterson Navy to quickly fan out five rounds into a Bear's head at point blank range to kill it quickly, though luck and the player's FPS are always factors. A single missed shot can result in death. Fast firing pistols like the Lancaster or Schwarzlose may also be effective with a bit more distance between the hunter and the Bear.

When threatened, Bears will almost never run away. Unlike the slow Gators , the Bear is as fast as a sprinting 3/5 speed Horse , and can catch up to any of the 3-star Horses when not sprinting. The Bear is also quite aggressive, attacking anyone that intrudes within its range. Bears alternate between traveling and resting, and make wandering the woods on foot dangerous. Thankfully, Bears are solitary creatures, and running into more than one at a time is very rare. When angered while resting, they will bow down and open their mouth to growl at the player before charging. This short warning can be used to attack the Bear. Bears will use their front left paw to slap players, with a very short wind-up that can be seen while they are still charging, or while standing still. Players hit by Bears will have PvP enabled, in addition to taking 80 damage on top of being flung, opening up the potential to also be damaged by falls when near steep slopes. After attacking a player, Bears will usually stay near their ragdolled body, making escape difficult.

Locations [ ]

There are a total of 14 Bear spawns in the game. Four Bears spawn in Bear Paw Valley , two spawn in Pinewood Hills , one spawns in the Whispering Summit Ice Ravines , and one spawns in Buffalo Ridge and Grizzly Redwoods . Another three spawns can be found in Tribal Forest and two more can be found in the Forest Cavern , with one of those being in Dead End .

Variations [ ]

Polar Bear [ ]

The Polar Bear was a reskin of the normal Bear, made for the 2020 and 2021 Christmas events , and returned for Christmas 2024 . It functioned similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with slightly more health, a larger size, and a white coat.

Legendary Bear [ ]

The Legendary Bear is a much rarer variant of the normal Bear, which was added in Version 3.4 . They function like the normal Bear, but regenerate health far faster, have around four times the health of a normal Bear, and can deal 100 damage in a single attack. Legendary Bears also run faster, are larger and darker than normal Grizzly Bears, drop far more Animal Meat, and also drop more valuable Legendary Grizzly Pelts and Legendary Bear Claws. They have a small chance of spawning in place of any regular Bear.

Zombie Bear [ ]

The Zombie Bear is a variation of the Bear added for the 2021 Halloween Event , and returned for Halloween 2022 . It spawned in the Forest of Bones and functioned similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with more health and a decayed pelt.

Baked Bear [ ]

The Baked Bear is a variation of the Bear added in the Console Support update. Unlike other Bear variants and event Bears, Baked Bears do not spawn naturally. Instead, a normal Bear must be struck by lightning during a thunderstorm. They function similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with more health, a larger size, added effects on its body, and a scorched pelt. It drops cooked animal meat instead of uncooked animal meat.

Sublocations [ ]

Fort Spencer [ ]

A Faction location, this Fort has the most Gatling Guns , and used to sell Volcanic Rifles . It is located on a hill, replacing the Bear Paw Valley Platform .

Fort Spencer Station [ ]

A Train Station built out of a repurposed Passenger Car , no trains actually stop here. Added in the 2020 Christmas Event Revert (Version 3.3.1). A wagon can be seen next to a windmill here, and Gatling Guns are being transported in the crates. A Water Tower stands on the other end of the station, and Bison roam the tracks.

Spencer Train Wreck [ ]

Across from the Train Station, a ruined Armored Car can be found, along with a destroyed cargo car, crates strewn into the field. This is a good spot to hunt Bison from.

Bear Paw Valley Train Wrecks [ ]

A ruined Combine Car and a ruined Caboose can be found near the waterfall that comes down from Whispering Summit . A Toy Train can be found inside the Caboose.

Bear Paw Valley Tunnel [ ]

One of two locations where trains enter and exit the map, a water tower can be found outside the tunnel. In the nearby woods, a ruined Caboose and Passenger Car can be found, next to a Bear and a river.

Dead Man's Drop [ ]

Dead Man's Drop is a large cavern within Whispering Summit, which can be accessed through a tunnel entrance in Bear Paw Valley. Bears often wander into the drop, and get stuck.

Memorial [ ]

A memorial for a deceased member of a developer's family can be found on a ridge overlooking the river and the tracks, covered in flowers and a sitar. It was added in the 2020 Christmas Event. The Gravestone reads, "In memory of a beloved family member who passed away during the making of this update." Underneath the message is a date, "December 21st, 2020," referring to the date of the passing of the family member. Near the end of the event, the message was changed to "In memory of a beloved family member."

History [ ]

Bear Paw Valley was added in the Easter Update (Version 3.0). It was not shown on the map until the Version 3.1 update. Fort Spencer was added to the area in the Free and Factions Update (Version 3.1). Fort Spencer Station was added when the 2020 Christmas event was reverted (Version 3.3.1). A wooden platform could be found where Fort Spencer is now located prior to Version 3.1.

Trivia [ ]

Five train cars may be found in the valley, but no locomotive is found with them. The area may be based off of Grizzlies East and Big Valley from Red Dead Redemption 2 , or the U.S. states Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, South Dakota, or Colorado, from real life . Every animal except for Gators can be found here. Bear Paw is famous for the amount of bears which can be found roaming the valley, making it dangerous to explore on foot. During the North Pole, players were able to enter Santa's Workshop by interacting with the Elf at the station while in possession of a Golden Ticket. Players riding trains while carrying a Golden Ticket would automatically be taken to Santa's Workshop if the train left the map through the train tunnel

4.1 Polar Bear 4.2 Legendary Bear 4.3 Zombie Bear 4.4 Baked Bear

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

Bears have very high health, fast regeneration, and deal a lot of damage, so approach them with extreme caution. Most sidearms and rifles are unable to deal enough damage to take down a bear in a direct confrontation, even at medium ranges. Groups of players armed with shotguns, especially the Mule or 1855 may get results, as well as hunting rifles like the Sharps or Hartford Rifle . The Spitfire Revolving Sniper is the safest way to take down a Bear, as it is able to deal heavy damage fast at long range. Bolder players are known to use strong fannable revolvers, especially the Lemat , Lochke , and Paterson Navy to quickly fan out five rounds into a Bear's head at point blank range to kill it quickly, though luck and the player's FPS are always factors. A single missed shot can result in death. Fast firing pistols like the Lancaster or Schwarzlose may also be effective with a bit more distance between the hunter and the Bear.

When threatened, Bears will almost never run away. Unlike the slow Gators , the Bear is as fast as a sprinting 3/5 speed Horse , and can catch up to any of the 3-star Horses when not sprinting. The Bear is also quite aggressive, attacking anyone that intrudes within its range. Bears alternate between traveling and resting, and make wandering the woods on foot dangerous. Thankfully, Bears are solitary creatures, and running into more than one at a time is very rare. When angered while resting, they will bow down and open their mouth to growl at the player before charging. This short warning can be used to attack the Bear. Bears will use their front left paw to slap players, with a very short wind-up that can be seen while they are still charging, or while standing still. Players hit by Bears will have PvP enabled, in addition to taking 80 damage on top of being flung, opening up the potential to also be damaged by falls when near steep slopes. After attacking a player, Bears will usually stay near their ragdolled body, making escape difficult.

Locations [ ]

There are a total of 14 Bear spawns in the game. Four Bears spawn in Bear Paw Valley , two spawn in Pinewood Hills , one spawns in the Whispering Summit Ice Ravines , and one spawns in Buffalo Ridge and Grizzly Redwoods . Another three spawns can be found in Tribal Forest and two more can be found in the Forest Cavern , with one of those being in Dead End .

Drops [ ]

Variations [ ]

Polar Bear [ ]

The Polar Bear was a reskin of the normal Bear, made for the 2020 and 2021 Christmas events , and returned for Christmas 2024 . It functioned similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with slightly more health, a larger size, and a white coat.

Legendary Bear [ ]

The Legendary Bear is a much rarer variant of the normal Bear, which was added in Version 3.4 . They function like the normal Bear, but regenerate health far faster, have around four times the health of a normal Bear, and can deal 100 damage in a single attack. Legendary Bears also run faster, are larger and darker than normal Grizzly Bears, drop far more Animal Meat, and also drop more valuable Legendary Grizzly Pelts and Legendary Bear Claws. They have a small chance of spawning in place of any regular Bear.

Zombie Bear [ ]

The Zombie Bear is a variation of the Bear added for the 2021 Halloween Event , and returned for Halloween 2022 . It spawned in the Forest of Bones and functioned similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with more health and a decayed pelt.

Baked Bear [ ]

The Baked Bear is a variation of the Bear added in the Console Support update. Unlike other Bear variants and event Bears, Baked Bears do not spawn naturally. Instead, a normal Bear must be struck by lightning during a thunderstorm. They function similarly to the normal Bear, albeit with more health, a larger size, added effects on its body, and a scorched pelt. It drops cooked animal meat instead of uncooked animal meat.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Bear heads may be seen mounted in Saloons , occasionally with Tomahawks stuck in their heads. The Grizzly Saloon is named after this animal. The heads have glaring eyebrows and mouths open in a roar, likely for comedic effect. The Bear has the most variants out of any animal in the game. The common and legendary Bears are supposed to be grizzly bears, as pelt drops suggest. In some Events, like Frozen Days , Polar Bears would spawn. What appear to be Black Bear skin rugs can be seen in some stores and houses. A tan Bear head is mounted in the new Crooked Saloon . This is likely the head of a Spirit Bear .

For a while, it was very popular to prank entire servers by bringing Bears, Bison and Gators to Bronze City and turn an empty lot into a "zoo", where they would attack players and take almost everyone by surprise before they would inevitably get shot and killed. Before you bring the Animals to Bronze City , you must follow these rules. Animals can camouflage into the dark during night, with near perfect concealment within forested areas, making it harder to find the Animals. Ignore the Legendary Animals , and the Baked Bear . You must have low damage weapons to make the Animal start chasing. Do not lead the animal to NPCs . Do not let other players kill the Animal too early. When you arrive at Bronze City with the Animal chasing you, it is very important to warn all the players in Bronze City . You have to type "/t" to use your Team Chat, and say "FURIUS BACO!!", and then use your Firework Launcher to blast a signal before pressing [R] to ragdoll and let the animal attack other players. You must have a 3 Star Horse . (Preferably the Mustang .) Animals can attack Protected Players. You must have the Ragdoll Button and Firework Launcher Gamepasses.

Characteristics [ ]

Big Jimmy gets his name from being big, noticably larger than normal players can be. He wears a Black Stetson Cowboy Hat , a TWW Settler 2 shirt, and some denim jeans , all of which are items that players can wear. Jimmy wears an eye patch over his left eye. How he lost it is unknown.

Big Jimmy cannot be punched, stabbed, shot, or damaged in any other way. Tyridge77 , the lead developer, states that Jimmy is an immortal being who gained his powers from drinking Geralds' blood.

Behavior [ ]

Big Jimmy runs the Black Market under Puerto Dorado's General Store . The Black Market is of questionable legality, and Big Jimmy is ready to defend it with his huge Mule Shotgun . Trespassers who stand outside the bars or sneak their way in without a Trade Ticket from the Auction House will be given short warning, but players with a Ticket can make a deal with Big Jimmy and purchase a variety of dangerous ammunitions , as well as the Blow Dart Gun .

When not patrolling the Black Market, shooting trespassers, uttering threats, or making illicit deals, Jimmy has been known to take it easy in an old chair, with a clear view of the door.

Quotes [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Big Jimmy was the first moving human-like NPC. Big Jimmy's Mule Shotgun is larger than the Mule Shotgun seen in stores and used by players. If Big Jimmy is shooting at a player without a Trade Ticket, pellets may also hit another player that has a Trade Ticket and deal damage. Due to the close quarters of the Black Market, the only reliable ways to avoid being shot by Jimmy are to hide behind the pillars or keep moving.

The Bison is a large horned animal that will charge any players who intrude on their space for too long, or thunder away at the sight of a player.

They are highly aggressive if attacked, though less so than Gators and Bears . Bisons move at very high speeds, able to keep with and even outpace some horses . They are not a very profitable hunting animal, being mainly known for their pelts and meat. However, they do not have a third rare drop like Bears (claw), Gators (tooth) and Deer (antlers) do.

1 Hunting Tips and Behaviors 2 Locations 3 Drops 4 Gallery 5 Trivia

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

Found in groups and having fairly reliable drops, the Bison is one of the easiest animals to hunt. The Sharps Rifle is the go-to weapon when hunting them, as it can instantly kill one when landing a headshot. If the shot hits, but is not a headshot, the Bison will be left at half health, and will either run away, or charge the hunter down. Most guns will be able to deal enough damage before the Bison arrives, should that happen.

The Lynx Bolt Action and other high damage firearms are also effective, capable of killing Bison at long range with two headshots. If noticed by a Bison, they may paw the ground with their front hooves right before charging, as a warning. Players may also fan fire with any revolver or fast-shooting rifle to kill Bison, but like the Bears , a missed shot often results in the Bison charging and hitting their target, tossing the player straight up into the air.

Bison may stand over ragdolled players, though do not usually lie down on ragdolled players like Bears do. They tend to stay in close proximity to the fallen player and will swiftly attack again if the player stands up, so injured players should wait for Bison to wander away or lay down before attempting to get up again.

Locations [ ]

Bison are found in The Great Plains , Pinewood Hills , Bear Paw Valley , and parts of the Highlands .

There are a total of 12 Bison in the game. Five are in The Great Plains (one perched atop a hill next to the southern stream and Copper Gulch Mine , four close by Fort Henry ), two are in Pinewood Hills (on the very border, where the foothills meet the train tracks), three are in Bear Paw Valley (next to Fort Spencer Station ), and two are in the Highlands (one beside The Quarry , and one near Sinner's Canyon ).

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Prior to the Forts Update , Bison spawned in greater numbers and were much closer together in both Bear Paw Valley and the Great Plains. Bison used to drop Animal Bones during the 2020 Halloween Event . Bison will occasionally try to jump, and may end up hanging in the air over rivers, bridges, rocks, or in odd locations like the The Quarry . Bison have trouble pathfinding sometimes, especially if you stand between or on top of objects. Doing this can be a good way to cheese Bison kills. Bison were hunted to the brink of extinction in the 19th century for their skins and tongues, as well as to starve out the First Nations populations. Legendary Bison are larger, rarer, and more dangerous versions of Bison. There are 2 known species of bison living in North America, the wood bison and the plains bison. The in-game bison highly resemble plains bison. Players hit by Bison will have PvP enabled even if weapons are not equipped. An old Bison demo can be found here .

The Black Market is a "secret" shop, found beneath the General Store in Puerto Dorado . A Trade Ticket is required to enter the Black Market. This ticket can be purchased at the Auction House . While in the Black Market, players cannot equip any guns or items.

Big Jimmy runs the Black Market, and players who possess a Trade Ticket can interact with him to purchase a variety of wares. Players who do not possess a Trade Ticket will be threatened by Big Jimmy, who will take out his Mule Shotgun and attempt to kill them, should he discover them.

Players may also trade items by sitting on one of the 3 trading tables in the Black Market, where they can offer up to 6 items at a time.

A set of clay stairs lead from the area behind the General Store down to a small corridor with kegs and crates stacked along the torch-lit wall. On one wall are iron bars and a locked door, barring access to the rest of the room.

Wares [ ]

Below is a list of all currently available wares sold from the Black Market.

Currently as of the latest update, all Black Market items are droppable, allowing for players with access to the market the ability to give away items to friends or strangers. It is unknown whether or not this is a bug or an intentional feature.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Black Market is full of kegs and bottles, similar to ones seen in Saloons , but the Market does not sell any Root Beer. It could be an illegal brewery. This is further supported by the fact that none of the items Big Jimmy sells are apparently illegal, which could point to the ales he distributes as the illegal activity that gives his market its name. Despite being a Black Market, it isn't a crime to buy, sell, or use anything in the Market. The door must be unlocked when entering and exiting, leaving players who try to slip inside trapped. Players with a Trade Ticket in the Bank, but not the Backpack, will be unable to open the door. Players that manage to slip in with a ticket in the Bank, but not the Backpack, will not be attacked by Big Jimmy. The Black Market is the only place where Auction items have consistently been able to be sold, with the exception of the Trade Ticket. Hits cannot be placed on players who are trading. Targeted players can sit down to trade, which will stop Hitmen from hunting them and fail the contract.

The Cherokee used river cane to make their blowpipes. Blow dart guns were historically used in Southeast Asia being heavily influenced by the Malaysians. These later evolved into other blowguns. Despite being used for hunting in real life, the Blow Dart Gun does not paralyze animals, and deals damage too low to be viable for hunting. Hitting a paralyzed player with a blow dart will not reset the timer. Despite being a reloadable "gun" item, pressing R while using the Blow Dart Gun will ragdoll the player if the Ragdoll Button gamepass is owned. The Blow Dart Gun has the lowest damage of any weapon in the game. The Blow Dart Gun and it's ammo, Blow Darts, are both droppable, which allows for the owner of the trade ticket to give them to a friend who does not own it.

The gun supports different dart types, including:

Paralysis Dart , which immobilize targets for 5 seconds Poison Dart , which apply damage over time

While not a high-damage weapon, the Blowgun excels at incapacitating high-value targets and bounty hunters. It's especially effective when used for stealth takedowns or crowd control.

The Blunderbuss is a massive caplock scattergun, with five different cosmetic variants, similar to the Kukri Machete . Obtained by collecting the Blunderbuss Damaged Gun Barrel, Damaged Gun Parts, and Damaged Gun Body, and then using the "Repair" prompt at any Blacksmith , a random variant is granted to the player, with an equal chance for any of the five designs. As a caplock primary, the Blunderbuss has a massive reload time, and a short delay before firing. As a primary shotgun, it deals increased damage to Animals, enough to kill a Bear or Gator in a single shot. It also features a very tight spread pattern compared to other shotguns, with very high accuracy furthering its efficiency even past the 100 stud range where its damage falloff begins.

Pros: [ ]

Cons: [ ]

Must be assembled from parts by solving treasure scrolls Very long reload Single shot capacity Cannot fire unless aimed Slight trigger delay Can be hard to use

Obtaining the Blunderbuss [ ]

Collected through Treasure Chests, players may purchase up to three Clue Scrolls per day from Sneaky Shane , though there is a chance of an NPC dropping a Clue Scroll upon death.

Once a clue is solved, and the location found, players may dig up the spot hinted at to recover a Treasure Chest.

Within these chests, a variety of loot and cosmetics may be found, including pieces of the damaged gun. One of each is required to repair the gun. Once all three parts are collected, they may be taken to a blacksmith, either at Pedro's Furnace or at the Wagon Shop, and repaired, granting the player one of five random Blunderbusses.

Mechanics [ ]

The Blunderbuss must be aimed to fire, but does not force the player into first person. Once fired, there is a delay shorter than half of a second before the gun actually fires, as the caplocks function. The blunderbuss fires five pellets, each of which deal double damage to animals, on top of the 2x headshot multiplier. These pellets tend to stay in a very tight grouping, even when moving longer distances.

Variants [ ]

All Blunderbuss of the same variant will share ammunition. Up to five individually loaded Blunderbusses can be carried at once, one of each variant.

The weapon's inventory description is a reference to Red Dead Redemption 's "Undead Nightmare" expansion. A similar Blunderbuss is obtained in the campaign, with John Marston commenting " I risked my life for this? A blunderbuss? Is this a joke? What is this? 1850? " The "Parts" item depicts the Blunderbuss' furniture, stock, and body. The "Body" item depicts the Blunderbuss' lock, hammer, and trigger parts. The Blunderbuss is split into the same three sections as the Martini Henry and the Rednose Rifle , and is the third gun to be made unlockable in this manner.

While it never needs to reload, it has a slow fire rate, and takes a long time to charge up to maximum damage. The Longbow is compatible with Poison Arrows and Explosive Arrows , and can only be purchased at Hunt and Trade in Tribal Forest .

Like all other Bows, when an arrow hits its target, they take 20 damage over time due to the Bleeding status effect . If a Bandage is used, this effect can be canceled.

High damage to body and head, can kill a player in one shot Damage and range increases when charged Quiet projectiles No damage falloff No horseback accuracy debuff Compatible with Poison Arrows and Explosive Arrows No reload Inflicts Bleed effect on hit Can nearly get instant kills to body when using Poison Arrows in conjunction with bleed

Cons: [ ]

Very slow fire rate Accuracy lowers when charged for too long Cannot sprint when charging an arrow Arrows fly in an arc, making aiming straight at long distances difficult and unreliable

Gallery [ ]

Mechanics [ ]

The Longbow must be charged for 1.6 seconds before it can fire. To reach maximum damage and range, the arrow must be charged for 3 seconds. If a player holds for a little less than a second, they can have an arrow in their bow without charging it. This allows for the player to move with an arrow ready, good for surprise attacks and quick charges.

Accuracy depletes after the indicators start moving again after meeting in the middle of the reticle. As the indicators move towards the center, every shot has near perfect accuracy. Damage starts at dealing 40 for a minimum charge body shot, and deals 56 for a minimum charge headshot. Damage increases the closer the indicators get to the center, and lock at maximum after reaching the center, even after they pull apart.

Once the indicators reach the center, a body shot will deal 75 damage, while a headshot will deal 105 damage. The archer has a very short window to fire the arrow with maximum damage and accuracy, as when the indicators begin moving again, accuracy will fluctuate. Damage will remain at maximum value while drawn.

When using Poison Arrows, no changes are made to the Longbow's mechanics, however players struck by the arrow will be Poisoned . Poison lasts for sixty seconds, during which the affected player will take 25 damage at a steady rate over time, and will be unable to regenerate health and stamina, even if healing buffs are used.

When using Explosive Arrows, a few changes are made to the Longbow's mechanics. Explosive Arrows can be fired at minimum damage far faster, however have far less range. They also take longer to reach maximum charge, and overcharging is quite dangerous, as the fuse on the arrow lights as soon as it is drawn. Explosive Arrows work like normal arrows, however they have Dynamite strapped to the head, allowing for them to be used like "Stickybombs".

Trivia [ ]

This was the first bow added to the game. The longbow is the only bow that can kill a player in a single headshot without the use of special arrows.

Trivia [ ]

The Bowie Knife is known for being used by James Bowie, a frontiersman and knife fighter, who gained notoriety for his actions and blade in the Sandbar Fight. The description of the Bowie Knife is a reference to a popular meme, originating from Crocodile Dundee , in which the lines "That's not a knife..." and " This is a knife!" are said, and a Bowie knife is drawn to counter a mugger's much smaller knife. This is the only melee weapon that displays on the foreleg, rather than the hips.

History [ ]

To find out more about removed features, visit Removed Buildings and Areas .

When The Wild West first released, Bronze City was a basic town with mostly empty buildings. Many of the town's shops and buildings, including the Sheriff's Office, Gun Store, Doctor's Office, a small house, and the now-removed Post Office changed positions throughout the early days of the game. Eventually,  many of the buildings arrived at the places they can be found today. The small house was moved between the Saloon and the General Store, and the Post Office was eventually placed to the right of the bank.

At the time, many of the buildings were smaller and less detailed. The Train Station was small, with white walls and brown supports. Where the Blacksmith & Wagon Shop now stands was Red's Mill and Furnace , and before that, a large construction site. Before even that, a large blue building called the Grand Hotel. The Doctor's Office was made of wood planks and had a brown wooden roof.

The August Update revitalized Bronze City, revamping the Train Station, Saloon, and Doctor's Office, adding a Freight Depot, pens for Cows, Auburn Hall, and a bunch of smaller houses. These houses served as decorations and added to the atmosphere of the town. Construction on the McCaw and Co. Carriageworks began.

Bronze City received a revamp in the Easter Update; the Grand Hotel was demolished and new scaffolding was erected, the Post Office and the other small houses were replaced with building plots, and construction of McCaw and Co. Carriageworks continued. After the 3.1 update, the McCaw and Co. Carriageworks was completed and the Sawmill in Red's Mill and Furnace was completed. The Train Station was remodeled, the Freight Depot was removed, and the Leaderboards were built.

During all Halloween and Christmas events , decorations were added to most of the buildings in Bronze City.

In Version 3.4.15, Bronze City was spiced up a bit. More trees were added and the streetlights turn off during the day.

In an unintentional update during Version 3.6.21, Bronze City had some changes made. Signs were added to the north and south end bridges, and the Leaderboards were moved to the east end. McCaw and Co. was foreclosed upon, and the building removed. A larger water tower was installed, and a Freight Pickup added to the station.

In Halloween 2022 , Guns and Ammo was remodeled from a small shop into a large two floor brick building, known as Kaz Co. Firearms . The neighboring Clothing Shop was also remodeled, and renamed to HENRY BROs. CLOTHIERS. The General Store also received a remodel. and was renamed Worthington's General Store. The street lamps were revamped, however, they no longer turn off during the day.

In Version 3.7 Red's Mill and Furnace was replaced by the "Blacksmith & Wagon Shop." and Lumberyard, where the sawmill is now located.

Trivia [ ]

Bronze City was founded by "T.Y. Ridge" ( Tyridge77 ). The Bronze City Saloon was founded in 1872. The Gun Store was established in 1889. The "oldest" building in Bronze is the remodeled HENRY BROs, from 1868. As of Update 4.1, the doctor's office is the oldest, being founded in 1866. Bronze City's two Outhouses are popular among players as places where they can either put themselves or a kidnapped player inside, throw in some Dynamite , and blow themselves or the lassoed victim up claiming that they have various ailments relating to "exploding diarrhea". There used to be 3 outhouses, however, since the gun shop & the clothiers shop became connected buildings, the outhouse previously between the two was removed Before the 2020 Egg Hunt , Bronze was often compared to Red Dead Redemption 2 's Armadillo, especially the Saloon. With more varied architectural and environmental changes, its current form has been compared to Valentine, of the same game, however it should be noted that an old west styled town is an old west styled town. 4,467 people live in or around Bronze City, according to the welcome signs.

As of Update 4.1, the doctor's office is the oldest, being founded in 1866.

Real-Life Counterpart [ ]

Bronze City is based off of towns in the old western era. Many towns in the past had a similar general store, gun shop and other similar cool concoctions! Most buildings within towns were usually made out of wood and stone, as in the past people did not have the same number of resources we have today. Some were made with sod or mud bases, depending on where they were located. An example of Bronze City's appearance is that Bronze City looks mildly similar to Tombstone City, an old western town in southeastern Arizona. It also features designs similar to that of Contention City, and other surrounding towns of similar design to Tombstone.

6.1 Trivia Gallery

Interior [ ]

Inside is a large room, at the center is the front desk where the tellers are behind. A large chandelier hangs above the center of the room, underneath the dome. Behind the counter is a large clock, and drawers of cash. On the left a metal door leading to the basement where the vault is. On the right side is the alarm lever.

On either side are stairs leading up to balconies leading to rooms on either side; on the left is a reading room with two bookcases, two desks and some chairs, some bookshelves and a grandfather clock. Inside the left bookcase is a lockbox on the second shelf that can't be interacted with. Across from this room is the bank manager's office. A set of golden scales and a wireless telegraph sit on the desk. There are two bookcases, one with a shelf full of scrolls, and the other containing two drawers full of cash. A portrait art depicting Callahan's Manor before it burned down can be seen with Leonard Callahan and his wife hanging on the wall.

Downstairs, in the basement the vault door can be found, outside of which are some crates and boxes and barrels. Behind the vault is a room with gold bars laid on the tables in the center, with drawers of cash lining either side on the walls. Across from the vault door are two safes containing 4 diamonds in each worth $500 apiece. They are locked inside a cage made of metal bars. The only actual way to access inside it is with the bank manager. At the end of the room is a boarded up entryway with the words "Under construction", probably for a new section of the bank vault intended to be built in the future by the city. It leads into an underground tunnel like a cave, with two exits, one leading directly outside right next to the waterfall, and the other being an underwater path that is very long and exits slightly down the river.

Storing Items [ ]

Inside, you can store your items by going up to the counter and pressing the [E] prompt . You get 36 slots to start out with.

You can buy an additional 15 slots at $1,000 per slot; for a total of 51 bank slots. More can be purchased for 75 Robux. You can buy up to 460 slots using Robux. After that attempting to purchase more will result in a red error message text reading "You can't unlock any more bank slots".

You can store anything from guns or tools you aren't using, to valuable loot such as rare ores and Thunderstruck Logs . Some things can't be stored. The bank menu in Bronze City cannot be opened if you are Wanted. However you can access your bank as an outlaw in captured Forts.

Gallery [ ]

Robbing the Bank [ ]

Preparations [ ]

Before robbing the bank, bring a stick of Dynamite , which is used to blow open the tunnel to escape. Exiting out the front is optional but risky. Use weapons for close quarters and taking out the guards quickly, such as Shotguns . Fannable revolvers and melees are also great for easily combating any players.  Dynamite costs $50 a stick.

Entering & Robbing [ ]

You can enter from either side or the front door. Entering from the roof is not optional as the dome is unbreakable. Once inside, you'll want to avoid setting off the alarm. During the day, there will be around 3 guards and 2 tellers plus 1 bank manager present. The guards are armed with Spencers , sometimes Auto-5 shotguns. The third guard will switch positions periodically, while the bank manager will walk around and survey the room from the second floor, and head into his office and repeat. If you engage them, the guards will immediately open fire while the tellers raise their hands and the bank manager flees into his office if he is outside. One of them will attempt to set off the alarm unless you aim your weapon at them. Stepping behind the counter or even pulling out your gun will automatically make the guards aggressive, sternly warning you to put away your weapon or leave before then shooting you. You don't even have to turn on PVP to damage and kill them or trigger them. In order to effectively pull this off, you'll need a group of at least 3 players, as the npcs have precise aim and you are in a cramped area with hardly any space to run around. Once doing this, you need to retrieve the keys from one of the tellers and head to the bank manager's office. Kicking down any of the doors can trigger the alarm.

At night, it is much more effective and easier to rob. At about 8pm the 3 guards start to leave and are replaced by a night guard for the shift. The bank tellers are also replaced with a single one and the manager also gets a replacement. By then you can kill the only guard, while the bank manager runs to his office and the teller immediately surrenders. Upon getting the keys from him by aiming your gun at him and holding the E prompt, kill him to avoid him running and being a witness. Go upstairs and unlock the office. Inside, you can instruct the night manager to open the cash drawers next to his desk, or open the vault. When instructing him to open the vault, keep your gun on him the whole way or he will run back to his office. Once he opens the vault you can get inside the cage with the diamond safes, unlike blowing it open. Kill the bank manager or he'll run and be a witness. Use the keys to lock every exit to the building and the basement door to buy time for yourself. Npcs will take a while to kick down the doors, but players can kick it open much more quickly. Begin robbing the gold and diamonds, then the drawers of cash along either wall. You can carry up to $500 in a money sack at base unless leveled up. Make space in your inventory for the gold and diamonds. There are 4 diamonds in each safe, totaling $4,000 in profit. The gold bars can range up to $4,000, being $200 apiece.

Escaping [ ]

Once finished, use dynamite to blow open the escape tunnel and make your way out. Upon going outside, you will be met by guards on the other side of the river open firing. You either have to get past them to Outlaw's Perch, or go all the way to the Windmill Camp.

Final Payout [ ]

$500-1250 (in money bags, depending on Outlaw level) + up to 4,000 (in gold bars) + 4,000 (in diamonds) = $8,500-9250 - $50 (dynamite) - any bandages. (In full server)

*Robbing the bank will give less money & XP in Private Servers .

Old Bank Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The original Bank was first teased February 3rd, 2019, and again on the 10th, with the cabinets and vault in the back hallway, no basement. The old bank vault had up to eight visible Gold Bars. There were a total of eight bars before. Later on, the number of gold bars was doubled to 16 gold bars in a full server, ranging with the number of players. With more than eight bars, they stacked inside of each other, up to two in the same location. It got often reported as a bug at first, players not knowing there were two gold bars in the same place. The prompt for the Gold bars used to say "GoldBar" instead of "Gold Bar". The money bag's message that says "Can't equip this item while holding a money bag" was cut-off before, only saying "Can't equip this item while." The old bank's tunnel exit used to be much smaller, making escapes harder. It was then widened. The money bag room and vault was originally on the top floor. When they were moved to the bottom floor, the vault door was changed and a door was added to secure the room. Picking the lock of this door would result in the player gaining $263 bounty. During the Christmas 2023 Event , Snowman decorations were behind the Bank counter. In the 4.0 Update, the Bank got overhauled completely, introducing NPCs and raising the rewards. The server no longer broadcasts a notification to the players, or puts the robbery icon on the map whenever the Bank is being robbed.

Location

The Real Estate Office is a non-functional building located in Bronze City , introduced in the Progression Update (v4.0) . As of now, the building does not serve a gameplay purpose, but it appears to hint at a potential building or land ownership feature in a future update.

Overview [ ]

The Real Estate building is marked by a sign reading "Real Estate – Land Plots Bought & Sold" , suggesting it may become a hub for purchasing land or property once the related features are implemented. The structure is placed prominently within Bronze City , near other key locations such as the Bronze City Bank .

Inside the building, players can find a seated NPC who appears to be the manager or clerk of the business. While the Clerk currently serves no interactive purpose, he does have several unique dialogue lines that rotate upon interaction, adding a bit of character to the building.

This is one of the first buildings in The Wild West to explicitly reference land ownership , suggesting a significant system may be planned in the future. Although it cannot be interacted with meaningfully, its placement and unique signage have sparked community speculation about a Building Update .

Location

Inhabitants

The saloon is located across from the Doctor's Office and Auburn Hall , adjacent to the empty plots, making it almost impossible to miss due to its large size. The main room features a bar hatch, chairs, tables, a Piano , a garbage can, a Broom , and various other decorations. There is also a Barkeep hiring post near the entrance of the saloon, to left of the double batwing doors. The walls have ornate motifs on the wallpaper.

Description [ ]

Exterior

On the front side of the building is a large sign that reads "The Best Saloon In The West". Above it is a larger sign showing the name of the saloon and the date it was built: 1872. On the left side of the building are stairs leading to a balcony. Behind the Saloon, there's a backdoor and a Hitman post.

Interior

Upon entering, the player is faced with the main room, which has several breakable windows and lights, tables and chairs, and the bar. A Piano is nestled against the back wall, next to a small sofa and a painting. To the left of it is a stairway, which hugs the wall and leads to a balcony overlooking the room. Upstairs is a U-shaped hallway with two bedrooms, which players can use to regain some lost health. Behind the bar is the kitchen, filled with cooking equipment of all sorts, and a break room with some more tables.

Trivia [ ]

The Piano plays the Saloon Rag from A Fistful of Frags when idle, which in turn is a rearrangement of Percy Wenrich's 1908 "Cow Boy Intermezzo". The Forest of Bones event coated the saloon in cobwebs, spiders, candles, and bottles, and slightly changed the Piano model, almost all changes were reverted at the end of the event, save a few leftover bottles. The Bronze City Saloon has been in Bronze City since it was established by T. Y. Ridge. It experienced minor changes in the August Update, with the addition of the Barkeep , and received temporary decorations for most major events . This saloon's building design was inspired by the Armadillo Saloon in a settlement called Armadillo in the Red Dead Redemption series. The Bronze City Saloon was given Christmas decorations during the Christmas 2021 Frozen Days and Christmas 2020 North Pole events . Just by the backdoor of the saloon is a treasure chest location. Due to the wallpaper of the saloon being a decal, if the image fails to load, it reveals the real brown walls underneath. In Callahan's Revenge , Myuu's 2014 track " Wasted Wonderland " on the piano here. It re-appeared in Undead Legends (2024) . At the bar table, there are only 7 stools with one missing.

Players can pick up Brooms by holding [E] when prompted, and sometimes NPCs will hold it and sweep the floor of a building. This clones the Broom and puts it in the player's hand; similar to Harmonicas in Forts . When left click is held, the broom is swept from side to side, and can be used to move items, players, dead bodies, and tumbleweeds . It also cleans dirt in Saloons.

The Broom is lost if another item is equipped, the player is killed, the player is in water, or they press [E] to put it away.

Sublocations [ ]

Buffalo Ridge Tunnel [ ]

Buffalo Ridge Tunnel is a train tunnel that goes through the mountain. It's an easy way to cross the mountain without having to trek around it or over it. The Train runs through here on occasion. There are two entrances from the cave leading to the tunnel.

Buffalo Ridge Peak [ ]

This is the tip-top of the mountain. The now removed quest "Reach a Mountain Peak" could be completed by hiking up to this point.

Cave [ ]

A cave connects the two sides of the peak to the tunnel. They are somewhat difficult to navigate and contain no ores.

Waterfall [ ]

This feature lies in the northernmost reaches of Buffalo Ridge. It is a beautiful sight to behold. The river that fuels this torrent is sourced from areas outside of the map, hinting at a possibility for a map expansion in this direction in the future. The waterfall has also been used as a staging ground for the Sinner's Moon 2021 Halloween Event , the cave under the top opening up into the Ancient Descent .

Buffalo Ridge Tunnel is located in the westernmost area of Pinewood Hills , under Buffalo Ridge. It is a relatively long tunnel; the longest in the game. It connects to a bridge, spanning the river between Pinewood Hills and Bear Paw Valley . The bridge connects into the Dead Man's Drop tunnel, located under the adjacent mountain, Whispering Summit . It has several entry points: one at the north end of the tunnel, one at the south end of the tunnel, and two through a small cave in Buffalo Ridge itself. There is a camp with some tents outside the south end of the tunnel, which is also a faction territory .

Trivia [ ]

Buffalo Ridge Tunnel was added in the Easter Event update. It has not received noticeable changes since then. There is an open area in the side of the tunnel that when walked into changes your location to Buffalo Ridge, despite still being in the Buffalo Ridge Tunnel. This is the only place trusses (the steel frames) can be found. Trusses are climbable parts. These supports are used to be large wooden beams.

2.1 Poison 2.2 Paralysis 2.3 Burning 2.4 Slowness

Buffs [ ]

Food/Drink [ ]

Food/Drink is the most common buff. Its icon is a heart with a "+" in the middle of it. It boosts the recovery amount from 1% to 2%. It can be obtained from consuming the following items :

Meal  (10 seconds) 4hp/second Root Beer (10 seconds) 4hp/second Cooked Animal Meat (10 seconds) 4hp/second Cactus Juice ( 3 seconds ) 4hp/second Christmas Cookies (10 seconds) 4hp/second

Bandaged [ ]

Bandaged is the best healing buff, activated by using a bandage , or being bandaged by a Doctor . It quadruples recovery amount to 4%. Its icon is a heart with two " ^ " in the middle of it. The effect lasts for 10 seconds, and heals 100% (+10 health per second).

Sleeping [ ]

Sleeping is a healing buff activated by lying down in any bed. It increases healing by about twice the normal rate, and stacks with all other effects. Its icon is a heart with a "+" in the middle of it.

Stamina [ ]

Obtained from the Doctor 's Antibiotics, Stamina boosts the player's stamina recovery rate for 60 seconds. Stamina regenerates incredibly fast to the point where it takes less than half a second to go from 0% to 100% stamina. Contrary to popular belief, it does not (or no longer) boosts player movement speed. Its icon is a blue lightning bolt.

Low Gravity [ ]

Low Gravity is exclusively obtained via Hot Chocolate cups at the Hot Chocolate saloon. It makes players jump extremely high heights while reducing fall damage to almost none.

Debuff [ ]

Poison [ ]

Poison is a debuff given by hitting a player with a Poison Arrow . This debuff stops stamina regeneration, and drains 1 health every 2.4 seconds. The effects last for 60 seconds, and will deal 25 damage overall. A green overlay will be present on your screen while you are poisoned, slowly growing more and more opaque until the debuff goes away. When used with the Bow & Arrow at full charge, it is a guaranteed kill. Unlike the Rattlesnake and Viper attacks, it cannot be countered with other buffs. It features a green raindrop-like icon.

Poison was previously given after being bit by a Rattlesnake or Swamp Viper . It is unknown if Greybacks applied the effect. It acted like an inverse Sleeping buff, taking away 1% health at around the same rate, much faster than the Poison Arrows' effects. Its status icon was no different to the current green drop of liquid with "Poison" underneath. The poison debuff can be removed if a Doctor gives Antibiotics to the afflicted player.

The Blow Dart Gun, used to inflict Paralysis.

Paralysis [ ]

The paralysis effect.

Paralysis is a debuff given by hitting a player with a Blow Dart . This effect lasts for 5 seconds. It can be noted by the replacement of the "[E] Get Up" prompt with a countdown that reads "(#) Paralyzed". While Paralyzed, players are ragdolled and cannot stand up. This leaves players very vulnerable to being arrested by a Sheriff or to being killed.

Burning [ ]

A burning Player.

Burning is an effect that happens when players walk through fires. This includes most furnaces , large bonfires (such as the ones in Howling Peak and Tribal Camp ), and player-built Camp Fires .

Burning deals 30 damage, and lasts for approximately 10 seconds, dealing 5 damage immediately, and then another 5 after each second passes. After six seconds pass, the fire stops dealing damage, but remains visible on the player for another three. PVP will turn on when players walk through the fire.

If the player did not step out of the fire source immediately after igniting, they take 5 damage after every second, until stepping out, at which point they will continue to burn and take damage for the next six seconds, and then just burn with no damage for the remaining three, assuming they are not already dead. Torches do not give the burning effect, nor do Thunderstruck Trees, Cacti, or lightning blasts . Rolling on the ground does not put out the flames, but jumping in water will.

Slowness [ ]

Slowness is an effect caused when getting hit by the Sheriff 's Baton once, or from the icicle arrows of the Frozen Horn Bow . Movement speed is reduced significantly for a short period of time.

Trivia [ ]

Despite the Root Beer's item description stating that it boosts stamina recovery, it actually regenerates health. The Poison effects are erroneously labeled, and the effect is actually venom, with the Arrow's description stating that the arrows have been dipped in venom, as well as the Snake attacks being from the bite of an animal. Previously, Barkeep Meals and Rootbeer had five "charges", and could be used to heal five times before being consumed. They are now identical to Cooked Meat. Slowness is not an official name, nor does any icon appear to indicate status. Burning is similar, but shows the player wreathed in flames. Previously, there was a removed debuff called "Hunted". This was obtained when the player earned 150 bounty.

--- Bullet_Penetration ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Bullet Penetration is a mechanic which allows bullets to penetrate through materials depending on their strength, and the material taking the bullet.

The penetration depth of bullets is influenced by the type and thickness of the material. Thicker materials will stop more bullets, while harder materials are more difficult to penetrate and may completely stop bullets.

The most common material in the game is wood, which comprises most of the buildings and Trees . The deciding factor in bullet penetration through wood is thickness, with every gun capable of piercing flimsy outhouse doors. However, only the strongest hunting rifles can penetrate a redwood, and even then, only at a good angle. Metal can be found accenting many towns and robbable locations, including Trains , and will stop all bullets in their tracks. The adobe that makes up Puerto Dorado and Outlaw's Perch is much sturdier than wood, but won't block everything. Specially modeled non-terrain rocks, slopes, and brick are near-impenetrable, though thin or angled sections may be able to be fired through with a strong enough gun. Glass is not only penetrable by even the weakest of guns, it will also shatter as bullets pass through. Terrain cannot be fired through. Fabric, cloth, and leaves can typically be fired through without interrupting bullets at all.

When a bullet makes contact with a surface, either entering or exiting, a bullet hole texture will briefly appear, provided that graphics are set to 6/10 or higher.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Tents can be shot out of with strong firearms from any position, although bullets cannot penetrate except for the face opposite the door. Strong firearms can shoot through any structure in Forts . People are often accused of hacking when they manage to kill or injure someone through a wall. Before accusing someone of wallhacking, consider using their weapon to shoot through whatever you were hit through. Throwables and other non-bullet projectiles (such as Bows, Tomahawks , and Blow Darts ) cannot penetrate anything, instead getting stuck or bouncing off of surfaces, depending on the material. Fort gates are bulletproof. Previously, they only acted as metal on the banding, however players could easily shoot through the wooden parts of the gates to kill other players attempting to reinforce them. Trains are mostly bulletproof. Tree leaves used to be completely bulletproof, though this has been fixed on most species.

Exterior [ ]

Approaching from outside, the remains of two towers and an archway can be seen. The arch has a cross on top, while the towers are in varying states of disrepair.  The Western Tower is mostly upright, with a large sandy green dome on top and a staircase leading into the main library. The Eastern Tower, however, is propped up by a rock, and falling into the sands, its dome partially buried in the ground a few meters away.

Interior [ ]

A spiral staircase leads down from the Western Tower, all the way to the main floor of the library.  The library itself can be found on a balcony above the main floor, overlooking a set of pews and a stage below. Four smaller rooms can also be found on the main floor.

Balcony [ ]

The balcony wraps around the building's main room, though is wider on the south side, where the library shelves can be found.  On the north side, a symbol hangs on the wall, which resembles Yoda from Star Wars with a mustache. It is lit by torches in wall sconces. The East Tower can be accessed from the south side of the balcony, in the library, however it is blocked by stone and sand.

Main Floor [ ]

The main floor is full of benches, and lit by large lanterns. An altar with a table can be seen on stage to the north,  and green banners hang around the walls, similar to Fort Banners . Eight doorways can be seen along the west and east walls, however all are blocked, sand spilling out of them. A massive archway in the south wall is blocked in a similar manner. The bases of the West and East Towers can be accessed next to the blocked archway, each having a table, glass bottles, clay jars, candles, and a bench. Four lanterns light the pews, which are in disarray, some benches flipped or shifted due to the sand.  Two small chambers face north, on each side of the stage; however, neither lead anywhere, one empty, one with a couple barrels in it. The altar is lit by two lanterns, various candles, and has two chairs on it. A table rests at the center of the altar, and has a red candle burning on it.  Below the altar, a mysterious trap door sits.

Halloween 2020 [ ]

In the 2020 Halloween Event , the trapdoor opened and contained a portal to the Forest of Bones . Players could spawn at the Buried Library. There was a giant Symbol and a sacrificial table for obtaining the Skeleton Horse , where you would place each part of the skeleton on the table in order to acquire the horse. There was also Witch Doctor who sold two unique hats that required 25 Animal Bones each to buy. Additionally, there were two Bronze City Bank Boxes located near the altar. Players could use Raw Meat to enter the Forest of Bones, and obtain the Skeleton Horse bones.

Trivia [ ]

The Library is full of mysterious effects. Noises echo much louder around the building, similar to the Church and most Caves. A heavy fog also blurs the player's vision while inside. Players' footsteps don't give off noise in most of the Library. The Buried Library could have been a religious or cult location before it was eaten by the sands. The lights in the Buried Library are slightly undersized versions of Puerto Dorado 's streetlights. The library is a faction territory.

Treasure Hunting is the main focus of the Version 3.7 update. Sneaky Shane has obtained a collection of letters, journals, notes, and riddles — all containing clues that point to hidden treasure. Unlike his previous venture , he's looking to make some cash, and will sell his clues to interested players.

Players can purchase up to three Clue Scrolls per day from Sneaky Shane . Prices vary by difficulty: Easy costs $1200, Medium costs $1800, and Hard costs $2400. Clue Scrolls are restocked at midnight, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) . In addition to buying them, players can rarely find Clue Scrolls by looting defeated NPCs , who drop them rarely. Each Clue Scroll will contain a riddle, giving the location of buried treasure. While holding the scroll, players may find the location hinted at, and then use a Shovel to dig up treasure.

07 18 2025 00:00:00 UTC until Clue Scrolls are restocked. Clue Scrolls have restocked!

After reaching the general area indicated by the clue, it may take several digging attempts to locate the treasure. When the correct spot is found, the Clue Scroll disappears and a chest briefly appears. Successful digging is accompanied by metallic clanging and thud sounds , simulating contact with the chest — a noticeable contrast to the softer sound of digging in plain dirt. To fully unearth the treasure, players must dig about five more times in the same location. Once revealed, the chest can be unlocked by completing a five-second prompt . After being looted, the chest sinks back into the ground and disappears.

When owning duplicate clues, each clue is used up individually. If digging continues after a chest has been fully revealed, another chest will be unearthed. This new chest may overlap with previously excavated treasure, but it can still be looted separately.

Be cautious while hunting for treasure, though, as some chests will include items that drop on death (gold doubloons, Legendary Pelts , Gems , etc.). meaning that if any other players are in the area near your chest, it's easy for them to quickly kill you and steal your loot. Private servers are also recommended for treasure hunting as there are little to no threats. If you're unable to get into a private server, always look at your surroundings and make sure you're completely safe before you start digging with your Shovel.

Players cannot open other players' chests, and will be met with a "This is not your chest!" error message. Players can still attempt to open the chests, but it will not work.

If a Clue Scroll is consumed, it cannot be replaced. If you solve a riddle and the clue scroll vanishes, continue digging, or backtrack to where it vanished and finish digging. If you cannot open a chest, continue digging. If you leave the game without recovering the treasure, but after starting to dig it up, the treasure will be lost, and the Clue Scroll will not be replaceable.

Treasures [ ]

NOTE: Scroll difficulties do not guarantee a specific chest , however harder difficulties are more likely to provide higher tiered chests.

There are three tiers of chests, each offering increasingly valuable rewards.

The most common is a wooden chest , simple and sturdy. The mid-tier chest is forged from metal , hinting at better treasures within. The rarest chest is crafted from deep red wood and adorned with golden locks , a clear signal of its exceptional worth

All items have an equal chance of appearing, save for the Thunderstruck Log, Blunderbuss Barrel, Molotov stack, and Ketchum stacks. Each of these items are half as likely to appear as any other item on this list.

"The remains of a wicked cowboy. These might be useful..."

All items have an equal chance of appearing, save for the Scuba Helm, Zombie Bear Pelt, Thunderstruck Log, Blunderbuss Parts, and Ketchum stacks. Each of these items are half as likely to appear as any other item on this list.

All items have an equal chance of appearing, save for the Scuba Helm, Chainmail Helm, Albino Gator Skin, Polar Bear Pelt, and Blunderbuss Body. Each of these items are half as likely to appear as any other item on this list.

Treasure Locations [ ]

Clue Scrolls are divided into three difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Some riddles are difficult to solve. NOTE: The following section contains spoilers! It is always more fun to first attempt solving the scrolls yourself.

If you're lookin' for a good spot to camp out, I'd recommend an old road that winds through the canyons, a path not often taken by folks. Follow it down a ways 'til you come across a small hidin' spot that's just perfect for a cozy fire. If you're feelin' a mite curious, you can dig up the sand and find my trusty ol' box, filled with all sorts of handy supplies.

I done seen the craziest thing the other day! I was makin' my way through them snow beds, when I came across a cactus just a-sittin' there frozen stiff! Now, I ask ya, who in tarnation would be foolish enough to haul a cactus out to the snow? Sure beats me!

Well howdy, if y'all are readin' this,

I done gone and stashed the treasure where the lavender glows and blooms with a luscious hue.

Beneath the towering spires of sand that overlooks lost knowledge.

As the oak casts a shade, the blind lady watches in disdain.

The crooked ol’ saloon’s got a secret hidin’ in its cellar. To find it, you gotta make your way down yonder and follow them ladders. But mind yer step, ‘cause they ain’t too steady. Your reward’s waitin’ for ya at the bottom, so don’t dilly-dally!

I done stashed my belongings, ‘bout ten paces back yonder, near that old west-most facin’ felled log what’s perched atop them Pinewood Hills.

Watch the trains pass, listen to their sound. In the Cadaver's Cave is where the treasure be layin', so look around!

Outside the structure, adorned with cloth, my gift awaits not far off. Tracks diverging, a deer close by, hollowed log signals the supply.

Listen up, pardner, to the one who's readin' this, my most prized stash of trinkets can be found on a wee rocky isle.

In the tunnel where trains pass through the Buffalo Ridge, a treasure fell and now hides, waiting to be discovered by someone wise.

I don't know them Callahans all too well, but I hear' that missy Delores with her inheritance, she gone n' given a portion to an old childhood friend. That friend met an untimely end before they could collect. However, I happened to hear it was buried 'underneath the biggest water trough in the land', whatever that means...

Spot the odd one out in town, my gear's tucked safe 'neath a tarp, underground.

A barrel, a bottle, and a trough filled full! No feed for the horses' athirst... but a chest! Waitin' for yee!

Yellow vase with minecarts near,

treasure lying beneath here.

Reckon my boss ain't never gonna give me a moment's peace if'n I don't finish scrubbin' these dishes afore sundown. Mind headin' to my break spot next to the back door and grabbing my stuff for me? Suppose I'll even let 'cha keep some of it.

Follow the noisy path into the sand,

Where creaking oak provides passage for the grand.

Beyond two fingers rise up tall,

Between them lies what you want most of all.

"I reckon I ain’t the sharpshootin’ gunslinger I once was, so I figured I’d hide my stash under an odd-lookin’ arrangement o’ rocks."

Splendors forgotten, an ancient warrior stands guard. Near pillars proud, the treasure rests atop the mound.

Standing atop copper, a scenic overlook of our bronze town is where your treasure can be found.

Where the flames of hell burn

bright, a gate stands to guard

what's in sight, the treasure waits

for you to see, so hurry!

Well, if y'all are readin' this, somethin' must've gone mighty wrong. But shoot, that's just the way the tumbleweed rolls! For those luckier than I, heed this:

I buried my prized treasure under a peak of bronze found near a mighty still' green water.

In a vast expanse of a sandy land,

The knowledge you seek is close at hand,

Buried deep within that sea,

Are secrets and treasures, yet to be seen,

And if you look to the tower not so tall,

You might just find what you need most of all.

Twenty pace north should set you right. Ten to the west, to the rock you should go. Ten more to north near loud and great flow.

Near the bridge to clay room low, Are secrets hidden long ago.

You're headed for a fall, be it to glory or the bitter end, your reward is waitin' for ya' at the bottom of a steep descent.

Hidden in a patch of clay,

South of the Lord’s temple where one might pray.

Embraced by marble, there my treasure will stay.

Away from the sapphire stream’s bay.

From a path of justice, guarded by an old warrior’s favored stone, and the love of mum’, my belongings lay down to rest.

My treasure’s kept atop an arch of gold, A sight to see, a wonder to behold, But heed my warning, for those who rush, May find themselves tumbling headfirst into a bush.

Reckon I'm restin' where the sun don't shine, on top o' a moonlit lake far from the sky. If y'all aim to recover my mighty treasure, then y'alls best be fixin' to take a long dive.

Near he who creates a small lake, I done hid my treasure in stolen land for heaven's sake. For months, his roar kept me wide awake, but my belongings remain unscathed beneath golden leaves, make no mistake.

Near the land of old, my secrets lie untold.

As La Grande passes, listen to its mighty roar.

Hidden beneath an aurum road, my treasure waits for the daring one to behold.

In scorching heat, where toiling's a must,

I hid my box near pulleys and rope, in trust,

That it helps you escape, in times unjust.

Where the giant's tears run quite stark, I dwell where they furcate, hark!

Trivia [ ]

Zombie and Polar Bear Pelts, as well as piles of bones, were specific to their respective Events prior to the update. Some chests may not pay off the cost of the Clue Scroll. Most loot found in treasure chests drop on death, meaning that other players can loot players that collect treasure. Private servers do not lower price of treasure loot. The Gold Bar (12) are the only gold bars that are obtainable by both Citizens and Outlaws. Players can dig a treasure without looking at the scroll. The notes used for the Clue Scrolls are the same ones present during 2019 Callahan's Revenge , 2020 Forest of Bones , and the Halloween 2022 Events .

Lore [ ]

Estate established in 1811. Katherin Callahan's Ghost haunted the Manor after her death. Car parts can be found in the Attic, showing the Callahans' wealth. Delores sells and breeds the best horses in the West at her Ranch, located on the estate. Leonard Callahan became obsessed with the Wendigo after finding its skull on a horse ride through Tribal Forest . The Manor wasleft abandoned after the murder of Katherin and the disappearance of Leonard, eventually boarded up, and later burned down to be rebuilt. Delores Callahan said that the Temple of the Egg was built by "Those pesky Moai", and was seen with a Lochke Revolver well before the gun released.

History [ ]

Not to be confused with in-game history. This is simply a list of changes to the area.

Callahan's Manor replaced Delores' Ranch with the Callahan's Revenge update. During Callahan's Revenge, there were many Wendigo claw marks and notes scattered around the Manor; they have since been removed with the revert of that update. Prior to Version 3.1 , there were a set of Cow pens near the train station, located where the general store now sits. No Cows were housed in them, and it is likely that they could have been used to export and import Horses . During Halloween 2020 , the Manor was boarded up, and made much harder to enter. Later, a window was left broken near the back entrance to make getting in much easier. Before the Halloween 2020 event was reverted, players could sleep in all beds found in the manor but two, the one in the attic and the one in the trashed bedroom. After the revert, all beds except the one in the Master Bedroom had their mattresses removed. This final bed's mattress was removed in Version 3.4. For Version 4.0, the entire Manor appears to have been burned down, renamed Callahan's Ruined Manor, and has had a piano added to the ruins.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

A painting of the "gnome child" from Runescape can be found in the rubble. It is one of a set of three (the others can be found on the second floor of the Puerto Dorado Post Office and the Silvertown Post Office ). The name "Callahan" may be a reference to "Arthur Callahan", a pseudonym taken on by Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2 . The Basement had been referred to as the "Old Storage" by Leonard Callahan. It is currently still accessible. The ruins of the manor resemble the burnt ruins of Braithwaite Manor from Red Dead Redemption 2. The burning piano in the middle could be a reference to the Flaming Piano meme.


--- Callahan27s_ManorHistory ---

Callahan's Manor , also known as the Plantation , includes the sub-areas of Callahan's Point , Delores' Ranch , and the Manor itself. The Manor was originally far smaller, and would not be known as Callahan's until after the 2019 Callahan's Revenge Halloween Event . Prior to this, the entire area was known as Delores' Ranch, and no plantation was present.

After Callahan's Revenge, the Manor would be cleaned up slightly. Later updates would result in more clutter being removed, and eventually the Manor being boarded up. A back window frame would be permanently damaged to allow access. Mattresses were removed at some point. In the Accidental Update, the worker cabins would be replaced by a fallen windmill.

Delores' Ranch , also known as Callahan's Point and previously known as the Plantation , is a small region surrounded by Raider Canyons to the southwest, the Swamp and Tribal Forest to the south, the Highland Plains to the east, and the Great Desert and Highlands to the north.

As its name suggests, Delores' Ranch is owned and operated by none other than Delores Callahan , a pivotal figure in the game's lore over the past six or so years. It is one of the main spawn locations that both Citizens and Outlaws can access.

Buildings [ ]

Callahan's Ruined Manor [ ]

This pile of rubble was once the largest building in the region, and in its ashes still lie a storied history. Before it burned down, it was previously owned by Leonard and Katherin Callahan , who have since become the Wendigo and the Ghost . This building was full of hidden rooms and secrets, but it fell into disrepair after the Forest of Bones event and was subsequently boarded up. Players could still enter by breaking one of the many large windows or by going around the back, where a broken windowframe allowed access.

The manor was removed in Version 4.0 and replaced with charred ruins, which still emit smoke from time to time. Eventually, a new version of the manor with more performance-efficient parts will be built in the coming updates .

Delores' Stable [ ]

A large building that opens into a paddock, just northwest of the manor. This is where Delores Callahan can be found; she spends her time tending to horses in this building, and players can interact with her to buy new steeds. Delores' Stable is the only place that 3-star Horses can be purchased.

Ranch Town [ ]

Delores' Ranch features a significant ranch town, with a general store, a jail, and a tailor shop. Any player spawning at the ranch will find themselves here. Not pictured on this page are a few other NPC houses, where the NPCs that wander this area either spawn in at or respawn when killed.

General Store [ ]

A regular general store with a broken wagon laying on the side. It promises "premium salmon ", which has yet to appear in-game. The store used to be located closer to Raider Canyons, but was moved to the other side of the tracks in the Progression Update. A singular NPC mans the counter of this store during daylight hours, guarding a cash register that can be robbed for $175.

Marshal & County Jail [ ]

A small hut where outlaws captured at the plantation are sent. It has one available Sheriff post, making it the second Sheriff post in the game's history after Bronze City's Sheriff's Office and Jail . The building features a jail cell, a bounty board, a desk with the ability to turn yourself in and another desk in front of a shelf where two Lemat Revolvers , a Mule Shotgun and a Sharps Rifle sit. When not walking around the ranch, one Sheriff NPC usually sits lazily inside this building.

Callahan's Point Tailor [ ]

Located right next to the jail is a clothing store similar to that of Bronze City , that has no actual unique purpose. It has a few blank mannequins displayed in the windows and two fitting rooms. Unlike the other clothing store, this building does not feature a robbable cash register.

Callahan's Point Telegraph Office [ ]

A small building on the opposite side of the train tracks, with a cash safe and cash register inside. One NPC usually guards this building during daylight hours, but he can be coerced into opening both the register and the safe. Besides its robberies, this building does not serve any purpose, other than being a decoration.

Callahan's Point Station [ ]

Separated by the neighboring Telegraph Office by a massive water tank for passing trains, this long station is one of three marked train stations on the map. Its ticket office does not function and the register inside cannot be robbed, but trains often pass by and stop at this building, given that the tracks are set up correctly. These passing trains are perfect robbery targets for any enterprising Outlaw.

Architect's Domain [ ]

Located beside Delores' Ranch, this odd rock has the symbol carved into it, with strange structures lying underneath. It is inaccessible. Attempting to interact with the rock will result in the error message "Your identity does not grant you access".

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

A small two-wheeled Wagon can be found outside on the northeast wall. It is most likely a small cart that would be used in the fields. The base of the chandelier inside of the stable seems to be a wagon wheel.

This building is used as Callahan Manor 's spawn point. There are three benches where players can sit while waiting for a train.

In Version 3.4 , a Mailbox facing southwest was added outside the station.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Callahan's Point was added in the 2019 Halloween event , along with the rest of the Plantation. On certain routes, the Train stops at this station for around 10 seconds. A player can jump on top of the station building by using a Horse , another player, or the Train as a platform. The rail schedule is just for show, as trains do not actually come at these times. One of the entries on the schedule inside the train station reads 3:10 (Yuma), which is a reference to the classic 1957 film 3:10 to Yuma . In the developer RedTrain's sneak peak of a new train, a new version of the station can be seen.

Changes [ ]

The Callahan's Revenge update introduced eternal night, the TNT & Detonator , the Wendigo , a ghost, and a new area of the map, Callahan's Manor ! This building related to the storyline, and inside you could find Katherin Callahan , the ghost lady. She would scream and sprint towards players who got too close. Upon contact, she would disappear, dealing 70 damage to the player she hit while going out. Katherin would also spawn at the graveyard . The map update also included numerous pumpkins, spiders, and other spooky decorations around Bronze City and the rest of the map. During this event, it is known that the Bronze City Saloon Piano played Myuu's "Wasted Wonderland", as a special spooky tune.

The event also introduced the Wendigo , which spawned in Pinewood Hills , Callahan's Manor and the graveyard . It was extremely hard to finish off and would run towards players, often killing the unprepared in a single blow. It also had an incredible 3200 health, the most of any creature to be added to the game up to that point. Upon death, there was a chance for it to drop a very rare Wendigo hat.

Callahan's Manor [ ]

Callahan's Manor was a sublocation added in this event. The manor contained a Wendigo spawn, Halloween decorations, and Katherin Callahan 's ghost. Prior to the event, it was the much smaller Delores' Ranch .

Event Items [ ]

Callahan's Top Hat

Inside the basement of Callahan's Manor were the Remains of Katherin Callahan . Players could bring the Remains to Dead Man's Rest , and bury them in an unmarked grave. This would give you Callahan's Top Hat, and put Katherin's ghost to rest. Players attempting to finish this quest would be hindered by her angered ghost, both in the Manor, and at the graveyard.

Wendigo Hat

To obtain the Wendigo Hat, players needed to kill the Wendigo, who had a 50% chance of dropping its skull as an obtainable hat.

TNT & Detonator

The TNT & Detonator mission was introduced in this event, a powerful two-item explosive device, created by Robert John Hudson , and hidden away in Hunt and Trade . It remains obtainable to this day.

Halloween Lore [ ]

The Wild West Halloween event was very story-driven and included several missions and the Wendigo enemy.

"The Wendigo is a creature of selfishness. Always eats more and more and is never full. Always emaciated, it never gives, it only eats and takes."

Leonard Callahan was a rich man, owning the Plantation . On a hunting trip, Callahan finds the skull of a Wendigo in the forest , which he then brings home to study. His wife, Katherin Callahan, is disgusted by it, so Leonard puts it away in the attic.

However, the skull's supernatural aura attracts Callahan and convinces him it's not something that can be scientifically explained, so he turns to Native American legends and rituals. Callahan quickly becomes obsessed with the Wendigo , wanting to prove that it is real, and harness its power for himself and his family.

Callahan starts by mutilating and sacrificing animals in his basement, but to no avail. The animals do not have the right souls. He then decides to try an experiment on his wife, accidentally killing her. Callahan's ritual succeeds, and he goes mad with grief over his actions and the influence of the skull, leaving behind the manor, believing that he can still hear Katherin's screams. Katherin does not receive a proper burial, and so her spirit haunts the Manor, where her Remains lie, and the Church, where she should have been buried. Leonard Callahan's obsessive wish finally comes true, twisting him into a Wendigo and proving its existence.

Two of the event's "Quests" tied directly into this story, one to kill the Wendigo, and one to bury Katherin's Remains. A third quest gave backstory to R. J. Hudson and his Hunt and Trade outpost, however is unrelated to the Callahans', Hudson having died 57 years before Katherin's death.

Delores Callahan is their daughter, who luckily survived, and didn't have much part in the Callahan's Revenge story. She lives her days selling and breeding horses at Delores' Ranch , where she can be found today.

Trivia [ ]

This event marked the introduction of the Wendigo , and featured the first bits of story present in game. Leonard and Katherin's story could be read from a series of Mysterious Notes found scattered throughout Callahan's Manor. The Symbol that was used to sacrifice Katherin has been seen several times since, and a similar ritual could be performed in the Forest of Bones event to use a monster's bones and an equivalent soul to bring the monster back to life. It will likely play a part in future Halloween events as well. Zachariah Henry is seen holding the Navy Revolver in the game's thumbnail, but the revolver would not be added until the event ended. 2019 Halloween had the first rendition of seasonal themed trains, with the first version of a ghost train circling the map. The Inscriptions located on R. J. Hudson grave read "went out with a bang", hinting that the player has to blow up his grave in order to receive Hudson's key. Callahan's Top Hat was one of the few hats that wasn't affected by a bug which stopped players from changing the hat's height unless removed.

Entering the Manor, and the Main Floor [ ]

The Manor itself has been mostly boarded up after the event, and as such, players can't just enter through the front doors as the doors are barricaded with wood. A broken lantern lies in front of the front doors, showing the abandoned state of the building.

To get in, players must take a walk around and look for a broken window with no panes and a warped frame, directly to the right of the back doors. (Players may also enter at almost any other window by shooting the glass or smashing it with their fists, but they might have to crouch or roll through some boards.) Entering through this frame puts them right into the the Northwestern Sitting Room . The room features a painting of the Wendigo on the wall and a set of the beast's antlers hanging over the fireplace. There is plenty of space to lounge in in this fairly open room. By heading through the door frame to the east, players will find themselves in a hall lined with benches, with the makeshift barricade blocking the Back Entrance visible to the left.

This hall snakes back around to the southwest, with another doorway leading to the Sitting Room. Following the hall to the southwest will lead players to a Library; lined with bookshelves, a single couch, and a few chairs. A single green book lies on one of these shelves, and clicking it will swing open the wall and shelf, revealing a secret room with a built-in trapdoor that opens up to Callahan's Secret Basement . This small basement is full of crates, sheets, tables, and toolboxes; it is where Leonard studied the sciences and later the Wendigo, going so far as to chain Katherin to the floor and stab her to death.

Heading southeast from the Library brings the player to the Main Entrance , boarded shut from both sides. A hat rack and bench can be found here, as well as a large stairwell to the northeast, spiraling up to the Second Floor . To the southeast of the Main Entrance, players will find the Kitchen , with a sink, oven, and various cupboards and shelves, each holding several dishes, pots, pans, and glasses. To the northeast of the Kitchen, the well-stocked shelves of the Pantry line the walls, leading to the Dining Room , which features a massive table and a hearth. Traveling northwest from here will lead the player back to the Back Entrance.

The Second Floor [ ]

The Second Floor can be accessed through a stairwell at the Front Entrance. There are double doors that lead out to the Second Floor Balcony . The staircase is left open, so after making sure not to fall back down, players can find another stairwell to the southeast, leading to the Attic . The Second Floor Sitting Room can be found to the northwest. It features another hearth, which connects to the one in the Sitting Room on the floor below.

Three bedrooms can be found on the south side of the Second Floor. The Master Bedroom and Double Bedroom can be found to the west. The Double Bedroom is the northernmost of the two and features two beds; however, the Master Bedroom, found farther south, features only one queen-size bed. All of these beds have their mattresses removed. Another Bedroom, found across from the Master Bedroom, has a small bed, a table, and a Black Bear rug . By using the doors near the stairs to the Second Floor, players can find themselves on the Second Floor Balcony . It hangs over the mansion's exterior and provides shelter for the Front Entrance. By breaking a window on the northeast side of the Manor, a Secret Hallway can be entered.  The Hallway has no items or decorations. Around the corner to the south of the Secret Hallway lies another room that can only be accessed by breaking a window. This Secret Bedroom has a hearth that connects to the one in the Dining Room and two bookshelves, one of which has been knocked over. A wide bed has been thrown across one of the windows in this room.

The Attic [ ]

After climbing the stairs to the Attic , players will find a large chamber full of crates, statues, bones, and even car parts. To the north, a small Spare Bedroom can be found, containing two beds, and a Runescape Gnome Child Painting . A round window and a spare Lion Statue sit in the southwestern side of the Attic, overlooking the alley of Red Oaks.

Lore [ ]

Estate established in 1811. Katherin Callahan's Ghost haunted the Manor after her death. Car parts can be found in the Attic, showing the Callahans' wealth. Delores sells and breeds the best horses in the West at her Ranch, located on the estate. Leonard Callahan became obsessed with the Wendigo after finding its skull on a horse ride through Tribal Forest . The Manor has been left abandoned after the murder of Katherin and the disappearance of Leonard. Delores Callahan said that the Temple of the Egg was built by "Those pesky Moai", and was seen with a Lochke Revolver well before the gun released.

History [ ]

Not to be confused with in-game history. This is simply a list of changes to the area.

Callahan's Manor replaced Delores' Ranch with the Callahan's Revenge update. During Callahan's Revenge, there were many Wendigo claw marks and notes scattered around the Manor; they have since been removed with the revert of that update. Prior to Version 3.1 , there were a set of Cow pens near the train station, located where the general store now sits. No Cows were housed in them, and it is likely that they could have been used to export and import Horses . During Halloween 2020 , the Manor was boarded up, and made much harder to enter. Later, a window was left broken near the back entrance to make getting in much easier. Before the Halloween 2020 event was reverted, players could sleep in all beds found in the manor but two, the one in the attic and the one in the trashed bedroom. After the revert, all beds except the one in the Master Bedroom had their mattresses removed. This final bed's mattress was removed in Version 3.4.

Trivia [ ]

Although car parts can be found in the Attic, according to the developers, it is unlikely that cars will ever be added. The Callahan Manor spawn point doesn't actually drop the player in at the front gate, at the Manor's train station , known as Callahan's Point . A painting of the "gnome child" from Runescape can be found in the bedroom in the attic. It is one of a set of three (the others can be found on the second floor of the Puerto Dorado Post Office and the Silvertown Post Office ). The Manor was inspired by the Oak Alley Plantation mansion , a historic plantation in Louisiana. The name "Callahan" may be a reference to "Arthur Callahan", a pseudonym taken on by Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2 . Callahan's Manor will be updated and called "Delores' Manor" in the next update, according to Developer Blog 7 . There were originally furniture that was blocking the front entrance doors (including a bookshelf, settee and more). The wall with the round window in the attic used to not have any collision, allowing players to make a quick escape from the Manor by jumping through the wall to the ground two stories below. The Secret Bedroom used to be messier, and had pages from Callahan's Journal strewn about the room during Halloween 2019 . The Second Floor Balcony doesn't have any barricades for its windows. If players do not want to enter via the first floor, they can climb a tree or use a glitch to then jump to the Second Floor Balcony. There is a sign at the archway which reads "Delores ranch, lots for sale" . This probably hinting the appearance of the new town in the future progression update , or even the chance of getting building lots for the building update itself. The Basement has been referred to as the "Old Storage" by Leonard Callahan.

It is only found on the Steamboat and has no restricted notes. As a Virtual Piano Instrument , it has MIDI and Band support built in. This is one of the loudest instruments in the game, and is capable of producing extremely high-pitched notes, though often has a grating sound. The Keyboard can be found in La Grande 's saloon dining room, right beside the stairs. "Calliope" is written on the body of the instrument. Pipes run through the walls and up to the top deck, where the Organ's pipes may be found.

Before Version 4.0 , the Calliope would play an arrangement of Waiting for the Robert E. Lee, by Lewis F. Muir when not in use.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Calliope is the only Piano-type instrument that can have the idle music disabled. Walk up to the pipes above deck and interact to turn it on or off. "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee" is a song about a steamboat by the same name, which won a steamboat race in the 1870s, though the song is about a family waiting for the steamboat to pick up their cotton. The lyrics can be found here . The Calliope is more out of tune than the Guitar from the rest of the instruments, making it a far less optimal choice for a band, as it stands out instead of making a blend. It was the most out of tune instrument in the game. The song the Calliope would play sounded slightly different than the actual sound of the organ. https://thewild-west.fandom.com/wiki/File:Steamboat_Song_-_The_Wild_West.mp3 The Steamboat Song

The Steamboat Song


--- Calliope_Steam_OrganHistory ---

The Calliope Steam Organ has much cultural history, despite being a minor aspect of the game.

Real Life Counterpart [ ]

While having other uses before and after 1890, the Calliope found its way onto steamboats during the 19th century. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the Delta Queen , the Belle of Louisville , and the President . It works when a sound is made by sending a gas (usually steam in this time period) through large whistles. A calliope organ is typically very loud. Even some small models can still be heard for miles. There is no way for the operator to vary any tone or volume. Musically, the only difference the operator can make possible is the pitch, the rhythm, and the length of the notes.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Calliopes are also called steam organs , steam pianos , or Calliaphones (if they use compressed air for gas). The pronunciation of calliope has long been disputed since they were used in public. Some of the whistles on old calliopes were originally whistles used on train locomotives. The riverboat calliope was originally made to replace church bells. The name "Calliope" comes from an ancient Greek Muse. After paddleboats went out of fashion, calliope organs went back to their use before steamboats, that being circuses, fairs, or parades.

Camp Items [ ]

Camp Stool [ ]

The Camp Stool is a small folding stool with a cloth seat and wooden legs. It can be sat on by players.

Camp Table [ ]

The Camp Table is a hexagonal wooden table sitting on a wide post. It is large, but is purely cosmetic, and does not have any functions.

Target Dummy [ ]

The Target Dummy is a human-shaped sack stuffed with hay. It has wooden arms and a stand, and a bright red target printed on the body. Arrows will stay lodged in it, and guns will leave bullet holes in it assuming Roblox is set to 6 (or higher) graphics.

Bongo Drums [ ]

The Bongo Drums are a set of three placeable drums that cannot be demolished after being placed. Unlike other instruments, each drum is individually operated with the E and F keys . Players can interact with one drum at a time, typically whichever they are closest to.

Camp Fire [ ]

The Camp Fire is a small fire contained by a ring of stones. It emits a large radius of light. Players that come into contact with it are set on fire . The Camp Fire is the only way to turn Raw Animal Meat into Cooked Animal Meat. Cooked Animal Meat can be eaten for a healing buff, or sold for 50% more cash than Raw Animal Meat.

Camp Bed [ ]

The Camp Bed is a small bedroll. Players can use it to sleep, rapidly boosting regeneration.

Camp Tent 1 [ ]

Camp Tent 1 is a white triangular tent with a Camp Bed inside. Players can use it to sleep, rapidly boosting regeneration, and will sometimes be protected from dangerous animals and gunfire, which typically cannot get inside. Both tents take 4.5 seconds to set up.

Camp Tent 2 [ ]

Camp Tent 2 is a green round(ish) tent, with a Camp Bed inside. Players can use it to sleep, rapidly boosting regeneration, and will sometimes be protected from dangerous animals and gunfire, which typically cannot get inside. Both tents take 4.5 seconds to place and to set up.

Special and Event [ ]

Some items in the Special shop tabs share the Camp item's placing and interaction mechanics. Similar items have occasionally also been part of seasonal Events . Unlike Camp items, items here tend to deal damage, or are used for setting traps. Due to the nature of these items, they are typically used in conjunction with Camp items.

Bear Trap [ ]

The Bear Trap is a spring-loaded metal jaw that snaps shut when stepped on by any Player or Animal. It deals 75 damage, and ragdolls Players. Animals will not be slowed down or ragdolled, but will take 75 damage if hit by the Trap. It can be reset after use, however it has short despawn times; unlike every other item on this page, which stay until the Player who placed them leaves the experience.

TNT Charge [ ]

The TNT Charge is a strong explosive with a large blast radius. It must be connected to a Detonator to explode and must be placed in advance. Unlike every other item on this page; TNT Charges are consumable and are destroyed when they explode.

Detonator [ ]

The Detonator is a device that Robert John Hudson left behind. It can be obtained through a short sidequest, and is used to connect to a TNT Charge. TNT Charges can be detonated by interacting with this device once placed.

Sled [ ]

The Sled was a placeable vehicle that was a gift from Santa during 2019's Winter Sale . It returned again in 2021's Frozen Days as a temporary item available for 15 Nice Tokens. It could also be obtained through the present in Bronze City during Santa's Request . Once placed, it could be sat in by multiple players, or attached to the Player's Horse . It was towed behind the Horse, until the rope connecting the two snapped, the Horse was Uncalled,  the Sled was Destroyed with the prompt, or it was destroyed by guns or explosives. It was removed at the end of each event except during the 2023 Christmas event. Once the event concluded, players who had obtained the sled during the event were still able to use it.

Mechanics and Rules [ ]

When placing Camp (and similar) items, a translucent green "preview" model will show, along with text letting the player know if the item can be placed. Players placing items will be pushed into First Person, and have their arms outstretched. Players cannot move while placing the item, unless on horseback.

Items can only be placed on flat terrain, outside of Safe Zones and buildings, and as long as there is space for them. Items cannot be placed too close to other items as well.

Most items can be deconstructed by owner with E, F, or G; depending on the item and prompt.

Players can only have each item down once; placing an item activates a short cooldown. Placing the item again afterwards will remove the item from the original location.

Camp items (except for the Bear Trap) will stay where they were placed until moved or destroyed by the Player who placed them. They will also be automatically destroyed if the Player leaves the server.

Trivia [ ]

The Camp Bed, Camp Tent 1, and Camp Tent 2 all provide the same Sleeping buff. Prior to the 3.2 Forts & Gatling Guns Update, Camp Tents provided Protection as long as the Player using it was Sleeping, and out of PvP. This applied to Citizens, Lawmen, and Outlaws. The Bongo Drums predate the Auction Update's Drum, and are the only instrument to not use Virtual Piano. They have six beats that can be hit; though only two can be accessed at a time. A Sneak Peek showed a row of Target Dummies on a platform replacing one of the Empty Lots in Bronze City, possibly as a shooting gallery. Placing rules were previously far more lax; resulting in Players being able to block doorways, cave entrances, create death traps, and even farm animals with no risk. Some bugs have allowed players to place Camp items on the surface of water, underwater on river and lake beds, and even midair. In the campfire's original tease, the flames were much larger. Sleds can be destroyed by shooting them or using explosives, but due to its hitbox being small shots do not register all around. It has around 110 health, but sometimes can be destroyed at less or more health. A sled can be destroyed by four dragoon pellets (which does 68 damage), but a shot from a Hartford at full damage (75 damage) does not destroy the sled.

Four Cows can be found in these pens, with two of each variety. The pens consist of two connected fenced-off areas, each with its swinging gate, along with a third gate connecting the two sections. Additionally, each section along the railroad has a ramp leading up and out of the pens, facilitating the loading of cattle into cars for transportation.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Cows try to stay within the pens, but may be pushed out by players on horseback, or wander out of the ramps. If significantly far from the pens, cattle may roam free. Trains may have boxcars with large side doors that could be used for transporting cattle from the pens. These doors cannot be opened. Early performance issues can be credited to cows, who were very laggy at first. A new sneak peak of an upcoming train shows cattle in a car, indicating that the alignment of the cars to the cattle ramps may have some use in future updates/ In the Halloween 2020 event , a sign displaying "Monsters ate our cows!" filled the (then empty) pens. This was most likely a result of the notorious Wendigo .

The Cattleman Revolvers are a pair of single-action revolvers, made up of the Cattleman Revolver and Cattleman Outlaw , unlocked at Justice and Outlaw level 20 respectively.

Both revolvers are gate-loading army style revolvers, and share stats with each other. The Cattleman Revolver is a recoloured Peacekeeper Revolver , with a brass ejector rod, a dark gunmetal gray frame with a darker cylinder, barrel, and hammer, and lighter wooden grips. Aside from the appearance and stat differences, it is also set apart by the reload animation, which closes with a spinning trick. The Cattleman Outlaw uses the Cattleman Revolver as a base, but features a different grip angle, a webbed extractor rod, and a longer barrel.  The Cattleman Outlaw has chrome steel making up most of the metal on the gun, with dark reddish grips.

The Cattleman deals medium damage to the body, but has a low headshot, killing in three headshots or four shots to the body. Where the revolvers stand out is their above average reloads, accuracies, and unfanned fire rates, capable of overtaking some rifles.

The Cattleman Revolvers are a pair of single-action revolvers, made up of the Cattleman Revolver and Cattleman Outlaw , unlocked at Justice and Outlaw level 20 respectively.

Both revolvers are gate-loading army style revolvers, and share stats with each other. The Cattleman Revolver is a recoloured Peacekeeper Revolver , with a brass ejector rod, a dark gunmetal gray frame with a darker cylinder, barrel, and hammer, and lighter wooden grips. Aside from the appearance and stat differences, it is also set apart by the reload animation, which closes with a spinning trick. The Cattleman Outlaw uses the Cattleman Revolver as a base, but features a different grip angle, a webbed extractor rod, and a longer barrel.  The Cattleman Outlaw has chrome steel making up most of the metal on the gun, with dark reddish grips.

The Cattleman deals medium damage to the body, but has a low headshot, killing in three headshots or four shots to the body. Where the revolvers stand out is their above average reloads, accuracies, and unfanned fire rates, capable of overtaking some rifles.

Much like the Bowie Knife, "Stab" can be activated with the left mouse button and is a far-reaching stab attack. "Cut" can be activated with the right mouse button, a wide swing to the right that has a shorter range but covers more area. These different attacks can be used to fight multiple players at once, in different positions. It also features the fastest melee attack of any weapon and has incredibly high damage per second

originally, the Ceremonial Dagger could not be rolled with, however. this was changed in a later update

Both stabs and cuts can be directed with greater precision in first person view, and even in third person, angles are impacted by the camera's angle, though to a lesser extent.

Chat is a feature built into ROBLOX that can be accessed by clicking the chatbox, or pressing [/]. Messages can be sent with [Enter]. Chat bubbles appear above players' heads when close by, otherwise always appear in the chatbox as well. ROBLOX's filters may tag certain words, phrases, or characters, replacing them with hashtags (#). The Wild West has its own filter as well, which can stop messages from being delivered, and its own option for sets of players who may receive your message. Users with Verified phone number and email may also use Proximity Voice Chat.

Team Chat [ ]

The text for Team chat.

A Roblox feature, players can type "/team" to send messages to only their Team . This allows Outlaws to communicate without having Lawmen overhear plans, for example.

Faction Chat [ ]

The text for Faction chat.

A new feature which allows players to type "%%" or "/faction" to send messages to only their Faction . Faction chat appears in a light blue text, and allows Factions to communicate without other factions seeing what they're saying.

Proximity/Voice Chat [ ]

Players with verified identification through Roblox can use their microphones to speak to nearby players, and will hear other verified users who speak. A microphone icon appears, visible to verified users, which turns green while its owner speaks or has their microphone on. It appears red when muted.

Chat Filter [ ]

The current chat filter blocks the sending of messages containing language that is likely to be toxic, notably "ez" and its derivatives. Built off the old filter, it no longer replaces messages; instead, it simply does not send them, showing a blank speech bubble on the player's end, but nothing appears in chat.

Old Filter [ ]

The previous chat filter in the game filtered out the word "ez" and its derivatives to prevent some toxicity among the community.

Anyone else really like Rick Astley? Howdy there partner! I had something to say, then I forgot it. I like pineapple on my pizza I need help, teach me how to play! In my free time I like to watch cat videos on Youtube Let's be friends instead of fighting okay? Let's meet at the Saloon and talk it over some potatoes next time, okay? Maybe we can have a rematch?

Trivia [ ]

The "ez" filter was based off the filter on the Minecraft server Hypixel . The Chat Filter mechanic was added because of a community suggestion. The "ez" filter messages were removed in 3.6.15 . Faction Chat was added in Version 3.6.31 .

Skinwalker [ ]

Players that talk to him find out that the Skinwalker is an enemy to their tribe and that it is taking the form of normal animals that are sacred to them. He tells players they need vials of Deer , Bear , and Bison blood to summon the beast. The Chief says he will reward the player to rid the forest of the creature. These include the Skin Walker Spear , Skin Walker Bow , and two Tribal Masks .

Washte Tribe [ ]

According to the Chief, the Washte Tribe had inhabited the lands "... before the time of tall ships and burning iron." The tribe has most likely occupied Tribal Forest for longer than the arrival of the western settlers. He also says they were driven from their land by settlers, and that they are just now returning. This is likely why the Abandoned Tribal Camp is deserted, and why the tribe now lives on a reservation.

Trivia [ ]

The Chief mentions the return of his tribe's people to their ancestral land, possibly hinting at the introduction of future Tribal NPCs around the Reservation, Silvertown, and the Tribal Camp. As of Update 4.0, Tribal themed NPC's can be found in Little Rock Reservation and a small tribal camp in northwestern Great Plains. Long hair was a custom that sometimes represented strength, virility, and rebellion against colonization. Wanbli is the Lakota word for "Eagle".

1 Presents 2 Changes 3 Totems 4 Sale 5 Trivia

Presents [ ]

Santa Suit.

Found under Bronze City 's tree, outside of the Bronze City Saloon , players could open multiple presents to unlock the Santa Suit and a Sled.

The Santa Suit was a set of permanent cosmetics and was obtainable again during Christmas 2020 (North Pole) and Christmas 2021 (Frozen Days) .

The Sled.

A sneak peak of a small section of the sled.

The Sled was a special camp item, placeable in any Safe Zone . Once placed, it could be hooked up to any Horse with a single rope. Multiple players could sit in the sled, which would be pulled by the Horse, so long as it had a rider. This item was removed upon the end of the event.

Certain smaller presents could be found under the tree, with gift tags referencing important community members, such as "Chester" and "Artheus"; both were former Community Managers for the Starboard Studios Discord server .

Changes [ ]

Bronze City was decked out in Christmas lights, icicles, snowmen, and a large Christmas tree.

Most of the game's grass was replaced by snow and the green leaves on trees were colored white, giving the map a wintry chill. Most water was covered in slippery ice and could be slid around on for fun.

The waterfall and river under it froze over, leaving a layer of snow and ice covering it.

Totems [ ]

This marked the first appearance of the Spiral Totems, rectangular stone pillars with a labyrinthine design carved into them, blasting blue beacons into the night. These would go on to be used in the Temple of the Egg , and with more functionality in Santa's Workshop . These totems were hidden around the map and had fun messages for the community carved into the opposite side of the spiral.

Sale [ ]

Early Access was lowered to 25 Robux during the event. VIP , Dread Pirate , and Hitman were all also 50% off. The Mayor gamepass was only lowered by 25%, remaining the most expensive pass. The sale was active until the end of the event.

Trivia [ ]

The Christmas update was created in under 48 hours. The Sled was the source of many glitches, often flipping over, flying through the air, or getting stuck in doorways, blocking entrances. Hotfixes were released to patch glitches caused. The wiki received a mention in the update, even though it was the fan-based wiki, not the one you are reading right now. This is the first recorded time the wiki was openly acknowledged by the developers and the only time it has been mentioned in the game.

Snowman in front of the Gun Store.

Most of the map was covered in snow, except for The Highlands , the Great Desert , most of Raider Canyons , some parts of Bear Paw Valley , and Tribal Forest . From place to place, smiling snowmen could be found, sometimes in funky places (such as in a fireplace or on top of a hill, looking down at the citizens of Bronze City), and candy canes sticking out from the snow. Most of the water on the map (except for the Steamboat's route) was frozen. The ice was very slippery and was quite hard to move on. Bronze City , the Forts and Puerto Dorado had also been decorated with lights and festive ornaments.

The large hill across from the Sheriff's Office —one of the best sniping spots in Bronze City—was made impossible to climb. This came with great disappointment to bounty farmers and local town menaces, but was created to stop spawn camping.

Paid Access Players received a Title , six new Cosmetics , and the Mare's Leg , as thanks for their support.

The update was patched twice, to fix bugs and reduce overpowered farming. As a result, there were three different versions of the game running in servers for about four days. Changes included making the Reindeer (before it was used as a "submarine") float in water, removing some Polar Bear spawns, changing Polar Bear Pelts' sell price, making the firework launcher quieter, making tickets respawn every 20 minutes, and several other changes.

Santa's Workshop [ ]

The large Christmas tree at the maze's entrance.

Santa's Workshop was added to this event. The area was the center of attention during this event, as this was the only place where players could obtain most of the limited items.

Entering Santa's Workshop [ ]

To enter Santa's Workshop the player needed a "Ticket to Santa's Workshop". When the player joined the game and spawned at Bronze City or Puerto Dorado , they could find a Christmas Tree or Christmas Cactus, and open specific presents to obtain a "Ticket to Santa's Workshop". One ticket could be opened in Bronze every 20 minutes, either across from the Sheriff's Office, or at the Big Tree next to the Leaderboards. A second ticket could be unwrapped in Puerto Dorado, under a "Christmas Cactus". Extra tickets could be obtained by Claiming an Outlaw's Bounty, which would result in a ticket spawning in at the point they were arrested at or killed. This method didn't have a cooldown, but an outlaw would only drop a ticket if they hadn't dropped one on their previous life, and chances may have also been impacted by crimes committed.

Train station to Santa's Workshop.

This ticket could then be brought to one of the special ticket booths. One of these stations was located close to Fort Spencer in Bear Paw Valley . The second station was next to Fort Tyler . Both train stations had a small booth, in which an elf stood. The player could turn in a ticket to get a ride to The North Pole. Once the ticket was traded in, the player would be teleported to Santa's Workshop, and the ticket would be removed from the player's inventory. Alternatively, players could hop on any train leaving the map and would be warped to the Winter Wonderland, losing a ticket in the process.

Leaving Santa's Workshop [ ]

Leaving Santa's Workshop was fairly simple. Same as with the 2020 Halloween Event , there was a portal, which once touched, would take the player back to the train station. The portal was a smaller version of a similar one found in the Forest of Bones , but made of festive reds and greens instead of spooky purples. Players could also leave by resetting or dying. Upon respawning, the player would be warped to Fort Spencer's Ticket Booth, no matter where they selected to respawn to.

Obtaining the Reindeer [ ]

The maze from above.

The Special Event item that one could get was the Reindeer Horse. Obtaining this horse was a tricky task, as the player had to face dangers and activate three totems.

Picture of the first totem.

The Axe Totem was found in a hallway of swinging axes. The player had to cross these axes carefully, because if hit by one of these, the player would ragdoll and lose 40 Health. Often, players would be ragdolled and stay in the path of the swinging axes, causing them to be immediately knocked down if they tried to get up.

The Bear Totem was guarded by Polar Bears . These Polar Bears had 320 health, an extra 100 over regular Bears , and were also more aggressive. They would not let anybody close to the totem without trouble. The smartest thing to do was to get a Horse , speed past the bears and activate the totem quickly. Release had 4 Polar Bears and 2 hills in the totem area, however the first patch removed one bear and both hills to make the challenge easier and prevent grinding. The second patch made Polar Bears take longer to spawn, and reduced their pelt drop rate and price.

Picture of the third totem.

The Ice Totem was located on a snowy pile in the middle of a frozen pool, full of floating ice. Players had to jump carefully along the ice chunks, as even touching the water for an instant would result in death. The ice was also very slippery. This challenge could be cheesed with the Reindeer Horse, or very careful riding with any normal horse.

Once the player had activated all three totems, they were able to open the Reward Chest. This Chest could be found at the end of the maze, in front of Santa's Workshop. Once the player opened the Reward Chest, they obtained the Reindeer Horse named "Randolph".

Getting More Tickets [ ]

Picture of a ticket.

Santa's Workshop Maze was a very dangerous maze, full of hard-hitting challenges and Polar Bears , and many players found themselves at Fort Spencer 's North Pole Station after an unfortunate encounter. Tickets could be obtained by claiming a bounty, at which point a ticket would fly out of the dead body, or appear at the spot of arrest. Players would not drop a ticket if arrested or killed twice in a row, to prevent grinding tickets with friends. The first patch made the tickets in the gifts respawn every 20 minutes, as it was quite difficult to get tickets or play as outlaw when entire servers would be fighting over one item.

Event Items [ ]

The Candy Cane, a reskinned Tomahawk.

Gifts [ ]

During the 2020 Christmas Event players could find gifts which could be opened for a Candy Cane (a Tomahawk reskin) or parts for the Santa Outfit . Outlaws opening a gift would only ever get Coal , normal players had a very high chance of unwrapping Diamonds and Emeralds .

These gifts could be found in preset locations. The gifts spawned close to Totems, and the reward at the end of the maze. If a player opened a gift, they would get one of eight items. The Santa Suit pieces could each be unlocked once, making up four of the drops: Santa Hat, Santa Beard, Santa Shirt, and Santa Pants. The Shirt and Pants are the typical Santa Suit, while the hat and beard seem to be Starboard originals. Another unwrappable was the Candy Cane , and 3 different ores . Diamond and Emerald had fairly high chances of spawning, while Coal Ore only spawned if the player had opened the gift as an outlaw. The Candy Cane is an item which looks like a candy cane, but is actually just a reskin for the Tomahawk . It has the same damage as the Tomahawk, and will return to the player if not retrieved. The Candy Cane could be obtained multiple times. Once a gift had been opened, it respawned at the same location after about 5 minutes.

Firework Launcher [ ]

Fireworks Gun gamepass Icon.

The Firework Launcher , or Fireworks Gun, was a gamepass that could be bought for 250 Robux, from Christmas Day to New Year's Day. The Firework Launcher is an item that can be equipped on a tool slot, and functions very similarly to the Flare Gun . The biggest difference is the flare effect, and that the Firework Launcher does not require any special ammo.

Player using the Firework Launcher.

When the player fires the weapon, a small firework gets launched out of the barrel, and after about a second it explodes. Once it explodes it creates a loud bang, following up with colorful particles into all directions. If fired at the ground, a lantern-sized radius of green light illuminates the impact point.

Many players wanted the Fireworks Gun nerfed or removed, due to it being an easily spammed item which caused a lot of noise.

The first patch lowered the volume, which could be heard very loudly from anywhere on the map.

Christmas Cookies [ ]

Plate with Christmas Cookies.

Although this was a small detail, there was a small plate of cookies on the counter in both El Saguaro and Bronze City Saloon . Players could interact with this plate to get a cookie. The max amount of cookies that a player could get was 3. The cookie could be eaten, which would give a small regeneration boost. Attempting to take more than 3 cookies, even if you didn't have them in the backpack, would be met with one of several error texts, like "Don't be greedy!" as an example.

11Denver22's Present and Toy Train.

Trivia [ ]

Several snowmen could be found around the map, in odd places. Snowmen outside of stores often held merchandise, such as the Tier 5 Pickaxe , Mule Shotgun , Sharps Rifle , Peacekeeper Revolvers , and the red bottle from the Bronze City Saloon' s Piano. Some were hidden in furnaces, and even on Bronze City 's sniping hill, which had a barrier added to prevent access. When the event was first released, you had to claim another player's bounty if you wanted more tickets. Later patches made Bronze City 's ticket and Puerto Dorado 's ticket respawn. The totems found inside the maze resemble the totem from the 2019 Christmas event, as well as carvings found in the Temple of the Egg . During the event, some of the Christmas presents found under the large tree in Bronze City were addressed to Discord moderators and other players of note. A board with the names of all Starboard was found near this tree, in front of the bank. This board was much larger than the one from the previous year. A toy train and present could be found in one of the abandoned train cars near Fort Henry . The present was addressed to "11Denver22". The player to whom the username belongs is the developer of the train-focused game "Somewhere, Wales". 11Denver22 is also on the friend list of RedTrain, one of the developers for the Wild West. Red might have added this secret to pay tribute to this friend of his. It's one of the less widely-known Easter Eggs . The Mauser was originally made as the Paid Access Reward , but was moved to the VIP Gamepass instead.

The large hill across from the Sheriff's Office —one of the best sniping spots in Bronze City—was made impossible to climb. This came with great disappointment to bounty farmers and local town menaces, but was created to stop spawn camping.

Paid Access Players received a Title , six new Cosmetics , and the Mare's Leg , as thanks for their support.

The update was patched twice, to fix bugs and reduce overpowered farming. As a result, there were three different versions of the game running in servers for about four days. Changes included making the Reindeer (before it was used as a "submarine") float in water, removing some Polar Bear spawns, changing Polar Bear Pelts' sell price, making the firework launcher quieter, making tickets respawn every 20 minutes, and several other changes.

Santa's Workshop [ ]

The large Christmas tree at the maze's entrance.

Santa's Workshop was added to this event. The area was the center of attention during this event, as this was the only place where players could obtain most of the limited items.

Entering Santa's Workshop [ ]

To enter Santa's Workshop the player needed a "Ticket to Santa's Workshop". When the player joined the game and spawned at Bronze City or Puerto Dorado , they could find a Christmas Tree or Christmas Cactus, and open specific presents to obtain a "Ticket to Santa's Workshop". One ticket could be opened in Bronze every 20 minutes, either across from the Sheriff's Office, or at the Big Tree next to the Leaderboards. A second ticket could be unwrapped in Puerto Dorado, under a "Christmas Cactus". Extra tickets could be obtained by Claiming an Outlaw's Bounty, which would result in a ticket spawning in at the point they were arrested at or killed. This method didn't have a cooldown, but an outlaw would only drop a ticket if they hadn't dropped one on their previous life, and chances may have also been impacted by crimes committed.

Train station to Santa's Workshop.

This ticket could then be brought to one of the special ticket booths. One of these stations was located close to Fort Spencer in Bear Paw Valley . The second station was next to Fort Tyler . Both train stations had a small booth, in which an elf stood. The player could turn in a ticket to get a ride to The North Pole. Once the ticket was traded in, the player would be teleported to Santa's Workshop, and the ticket would be removed from the player's inventory. Alternatively, players could hop on any train leaving the map and would be warped to the Winter Wonderland, losing a ticket in the process.

Leaving Santa's Workshop [ ]

Leaving Santa's Workshop was fairly simple. Same as with the 2020 Halloween Event , there was a portal, which once touched, would take the player back to the train station. The portal was a smaller version of a similar one found in the Forest of Bones , but made of festive reds and greens instead of spooky purples. Players could also leave by resetting or dying. Upon respawning, the player would be warped to Fort Spencer's Ticket Booth, no matter where they selected to respawn to.

Obtaining the Reindeer [ ]

The maze from above.

The Special Event item that one could get was the Reindeer Horse. Obtaining this horse was a tricky task, as the player had to face dangers and activate three totems.

Picture of the first totem.

The Axe Totem was found in a hallway of swinging axes. The player had to cross these axes carefully, because if hit by one of these, the player would ragdoll and lose 40 Health. Often, players would be ragdolled and stay in the path of the swinging axes, causing them to be immediately knocked down if they tried to get up.

The Bear Totem was guarded by Polar Bears . These Polar Bears had 320 health, an extra 100 over regular Bears , and were also more aggressive. They would not let anybody close to the totem without trouble. The smartest thing to do was to get a Horse , speed past the bears and activate the totem quickly. Release had 4 Polar Bears and 2 hills in the totem area, however the first patch removed one bear and both hills to make the challenge easier and prevent grinding. The second patch made Polar Bears take longer to spawn, and reduced their pelt drop rate and price.

Picture of the third totem.

The Ice Totem was located on a snowy pile in the middle of a frozen pool, full of floating ice. Players had to jump carefully along the ice chunks, as even touching the water for an instant would result in death. The ice was also very slippery. This challenge could be cheesed with the Reindeer Horse, or very careful riding with any normal horse.

Once the player had activated all three totems, they were able to open the Reward Chest. This Chest could be found at the end of the maze, in front of Santa's Workshop. Once the player opened the Reward Chest, they obtained the Reindeer Horse named "Randolph".

Getting More Tickets [ ]

Picture of a ticket.

Santa's Workshop Maze was a very dangerous maze, full of hard-hitting challenges and Polar Bears , and many players found themselves at Fort Spencer 's North Pole Station after an unfortunate encounter. Tickets could be obtained by claiming a bounty, at which point a ticket would fly out of the dead body, or appear at the spot of arrest. Players would not drop a ticket if arrested or killed twice in a row, to prevent grinding tickets with friends. The first patch made the tickets in the gifts respawn every 20 minutes, as it was quite difficult to get tickets or play as outlaw when entire servers would be fighting over one item.

Event Items [ ]

The Candy Cane, a reskinned Tomahawk.

Gifts [ ]

During the 2020 Christmas Event players could find gifts which could be opened for a Candy Cane (a Tomahawk reskin) or parts for the Santa Outfit . Outlaws opening a gift would only ever get Coal , normal players had a very high chance of unwrapping Diamonds and Emeralds .

These gifts could be found in preset locations. The gifts spawned close to Totems, and the reward at the end of the maze. If a player opened a gift, they would get one of eight items. The Santa Suit pieces could each be unlocked once, making up four of the drops: Santa Hat, Santa Beard, Santa Shirt, and Santa Pants. The Shirt and Pants are the typical Santa Suit, while the hat and beard seem to be Starboard originals. Another unwrappable was the Candy Cane , and 3 different ores . Diamond and Emerald had fairly high chances of spawning, while Coal Ore only spawned if the player had opened the gift as an outlaw. The Candy Cane is an item which looks like a candy cane, but is actually just a reskin for the Tomahawk . It has the same damage as the Tomahawk, and will return to the player if not retrieved. The Candy Cane could be obtained multiple times. Once a gift had been opened, it respawned at the same location after about 5 minutes.

Firework Launcher [ ]

Fireworks Gun gamepass Icon.

The Firework Launcher , or Fireworks Gun, was a gamepass that could be bought for 250 Robux, from Christmas Day to New Year's Day. The Firework Launcher is an item that can be equipped on a tool slot, and functions very similarly to the Flare Gun . The biggest difference is the flare effect, and that the Firework Launcher does not require any special ammo.

Player using the Firework Launcher.

When the player fires the weapon, a small firework gets launched out of the barrel, and after about a second it explodes. Once it explodes it creates a loud bang, following up with colorful particles into all directions. If fired at the ground, a lantern-sized radius of green light illuminates the impact point.

Many players wanted the Fireworks Gun nerfed or removed, due to it being an easily spammed item which caused a lot of noise.

The first patch lowered the volume, which could be heard very loudly from anywhere on the map.

Christmas Cookies [ ]

Plate with Christmas Cookies.

Although this was a small detail, there was a small plate of cookies on the counter in both El Saguaro and Bronze City Saloon . Players could interact with this plate to get a cookie. The max amount of cookies that a player could get was 3. The cookie could be eaten, which would give a small regeneration boost. Attempting to take more than 3 cookies, even if you didn't have them in the backpack, would be met with one of several error texts, like "Don't be greedy!" as an example.

11Denver22's Present and Toy Train.

Trivia [ ]

Several snowmen could be found around the map, in odd places. Snowmen outside of stores often held merchandise, such as the Tier 5 Pickaxe , Mule Shotgun , Sharps Rifle , Peacekeeper Revolvers , and the red bottle from the Bronze City Saloon' s Piano. Some were hidden in furnaces, and even on Bronze City 's sniping hill, which had a barrier added to prevent access. When the event was first released, you had to claim another player's bounty if you wanted more tickets. Later patches made Bronze City 's ticket and Puerto Dorado 's ticket respawn. The totems found inside the maze resemble the totem from the 2019 Christmas event, as well as carvings found in the Temple of the Egg . During the event, some of the Christmas presents found under the large tree in Bronze City were addressed to Discord moderators and other players of note. A board with the names of all Starboard was found near this tree, in front of the bank. This board was much larger than the one from the previous year. A toy train and present could be found in one of the abandoned train cars near Fort Henry . The present was addressed to "11Denver22". The player to whom the username belongs is the developer of the train-focused game "Somewhere, Wales". 11Denver22 is also on the friend list of RedTrain, one of the developers for the Wild West. Red might have added this secret to pay tribute to this friend of his. It's one of the less widely-known Easter Eggs . The Mauser was originally made as the Paid Access Reward , but was moved to the VIP Gamepass instead.

Changes [ ]

Like prior Christmas events , the map was made more festive and wintry. Bronze City , Puerto Dorado , and Silvertown all received snow and Christmas decorations, similar to the year before. Most of the rivers and lakes around the map received a coating of ice, save for the Steamboat 's route. The ice was very slippery and was difficult to move on. Polar Bears had returned to the West, inhabiting the cold crevices of Raider Canyons and the Raider Canyons Mine . Their health was still more than a normal Grizzly Bear 's, but not by much, though their pelts were now an extremely rare drop.

In Bronze City, a special gift laid in wait for players to discover. This gift contained a Snowball and the once-removed Sled. Players could make up to 5 snowballs when standing on snow and could throw them at other players or animals. They could also attach the sleigh to their horses to take friends out for a ride.

Members of the Starboard Studios staff team had a different surprise underneath the Christmas tree—wrapped in a special Starboard Studios Rangers present. When opened, this present contained $25,000, the Frozen Aequitas Revolver , and a special message from the developers.

The focal point of this event was the iced-up version of Raider Canyons and Outlaw's Perch . The sandstone that was once there had been turned to ice and snow. Krampus had built a massive fortress for himself and his Evil Snowmen underlings, and it was the job of all the do-gooders to try to stop him from stealing presents and selling them in his illegal shop . To combat Krampus' evil influence, Santa and his Elves had moved into the Copper Gulch Mine from their faraway Workshop, and had set up a Gift Shop .

Axes , Knives , and Pickaxes were updated. Axes were given more sound effects, with both them and the Knives now able to break glass. Pickaxes were updated visually; their handles were no longer made of Roblox's wood, and the colors of the wood matched those of the Axes .

Krampus' Keep [ ]

Krampus' Keep , a large castle within Raider Canyons, was a modified area and new building added for the event. Krampus and his lackeys built this sinister-looking lair, and used it to defend and hoard their stolen loot.

The castle was on top of one of the many plateaus that form the Canyons. It had three entrances. Two opened into Krampus' boss arena, one across Outlaw Perch's broken bridge, and one around the back, above the Lake Cave entrance. Facing Callahan's Point and into the Canyons, a small tunnel could be found, full of ice and swinging axes. Through these hazards, a ladder led up into the Keep's interior, where players could enter the arena or climb a spiral staircase to the Throne and Present Rooms. Polar Bears wandered the Canyons: one spawned near the pair of disconnected guard towers across the tunnel; and one defended the rear gate, above the Lake Cave; and one lurked in the darkness in the Raider Canyons Mine .

Krampus [ ]

Krampus sat idle within his Keep, with two Evil Snowmen guarding him, armed with magical Volcanic Rifles . The event offers two paths and reward sets to be fought for during the Frozen Days.

Join forces with Krampus and become his little helper! Defend Krampus, and kill Citizens for Naughty Tokens , which you can then redeem for loot at Krampus' Contraband. For Outlaws protecting Krampus, they have the simple task of killing the pesky do-gooders who try and harm him.

Help Santa get back his presents! Kill Krampus and anyone who stands at his side for a chance at Nice Tokens ! These can be redeemed for loot at Santa's Gift Shop. For Citizens, it's a bit tougher. Krampus has more health than the Legendary Skeleton did, and can spawn multiple ice crystals which heal him. He also has Evil Snowmen minions which spawn throughout the fight, when the crystals are active, as well as any Outlaws who have come in search of Naughty Tokens.

Obtained at Stolen Presents room in the Krampus' Keep after defeating Krampus. Stacks to four.

Krampus' Contraband [ ]

Krampus' Contraband had replaced The Crooked Saloon in Outlaw's Perch . Krampus' powers had altered the region, the area covered in snow, the adobe replaced with a blue stone, similar to the rest of the Canyons.

Wares [ ]

The currency used to buy wares in Krampus' Contraband was Naughty Tokens, not money. You could obtain Naughty Tokens by killing Citizens within Raider Canyons territory and anywhere else the Frozen Days message appears.

Santa's Gift Shop [ ]

Santa's Gift Shop was located inside of the Copper Gulch Mine complex, rebranded as Santa's Workshop. The mine operations had been hijacked; the equipment now pushed presents through and some of the minecarts were with sleighs. If you returned a stolen present from Krampus' Keep to Santa, you would receive $100 per present. The gift shop was guarded by Elves , who were more than willing to shoot Outlaws dead with their cannons.

Wares [ ]

The currency used to buy wares in Santa's Gift Shop was Nice Tokens, not money. You could obtain Nice Tokens by killing Outlaws within Raider Canyons .

10 Nice Tokens for hat

Other Loot [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Evil Snowmen and Elves were the third set of NPCs added to The Wild West . Reindeer , the Sled, Candy Canes , Christmas Cookies , and Santa's Hat and Beard were all returning rewards from previous events. The Cookies received a new model, and the "Typical Santa Suit" was replaced with a Starboard-made Santa Suit, complete with properly placed boots. The Spencer Repeating Carbine and Marlin Pump Shotgun were being used by Snowmen, but the shotgun was replaced with a Winchester Rifle early in the event to reduce lag. The Bridge Leading To The Keep From Outlaw's Perch Was Previously Whole, Until "Destroyed By Santa" Because Outlaws Could Get To Krampus' Keep Too Fast After Spawning, This Failed However, As Outlaws Soon Learned To Use Horses (Specifically The Reindeer) To Jump The Gap.

Santa's Request was the 2023 Christmas mini-update. Released early on December 25th, it lasted a month and a week.

Changes [ ]

The mini-update reverted 3.9's Undead Legends event. The various shades of orange, brown, and red leaves were removed from the trees, returning to green, or replaced with white to give the appearance of collecting snow. The Electro-Resurgence Engine was removed, as was the tower tapping into the City 's power lines . The graves and coffins have been reburied. Pastor Everett is nowhere to be seen. Dr. Lazarus is presumably dead. Demon Hunter Jane can no longer be found hunting demons. The Wendigo Cultists were removed from the Abandoned Tribal Camp , which once again lies empty. The Marauder was removed.

Snowy weather occurred all over the map, even in The Great Desert . Santa had once again taken over Copper Gulch Mine , rebranding the facilities to Santa's Workshop . The Aurora Borealis could be seen shimmering in the sky across the map. The Sled returned, and the Firework Launcher was made purchasable again.

In an attempt to replace Elf labor with cheaper artificial options, Santa hired Krampus' Snowmen , which quickly realized they were being taken advantage of under poor working conditions. Taking the presents with them, they armed themselves with the newly-remodeled and revamped YellowBoy Rifles after Santa attempted to stop them from forming a Union by calling in the Pinkertons. With no Elves, no Snowmen, and no Pinkertons, Santa turned to the Players for help "melting" the Snowmen.

Along with the revamped YellowBoy, which now appears to be a seven round carbine complete with a saddle ring, the Rednose Rifle was also added. An ornately decorated YellowBoy with red dot sights, the pieces could be obtained by killing Snowmen, and then returned to Santa to be assembled.

Announcement Message [ ]

Hey Folks,

Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you are having a wonderful holiday season and a Christmas eve. This update is short, but hopefully sweet, so I'll get straight to business. Santa needs your help with a little problem of his: evil snowmen. If you wish to make the most your spoils of war, make sure to have a word with Santa before the end of this year.

Don't forget, Christmas is about giving, and so for this event, we encourage you to share in the gifts and exchange the goodies that you find with the good folk of Bronze City!

MINI-UPDATE 3.9.1: SANTA'S REQUEST

🔸5 new free cosmetics! (4 Hats & a Scarf)

🔸A new holiday themed rifle to collect

🔸Evil snowmen to destroy

On a personal note, this year our team has been spending time with our families, but we still wanted to give a little something back to our community. Don't expect this update to be big, although we hope you will enjoy it nonetheless.

Spend time with family, put on the cozy knitted sweater, make some hot chocolate, and if your mom dragged you to a family Christmas party that you didn't want to go to, hop on The Wild West and shoot some snowmen with your friends. And as always, thank you for your everlasting support!

Don't forget, Christmas is about giving, and so for this event, we encourage you to share in the gifts and exchange the goodies that you find with the good folk of Bronze City!

MINI-UPDATE 3.9.1: SANTA'S REQUEST

GO TALK TO SANTA, HE'S IN HIS WORKSHOP AT COPPER GULCH

Highlights Include:

🔸YellowBoy Rifle revamp/buff

🔸5 new free cosmetics! (4 Hats & a Scarf)

🔸A new holiday themed rifle to collect

🔸Evil snowmen to destroy

🔸Gifts under the tree

🔸And a questionably ethical Santa to appease

On a personal note, this year our team has been spending time with our families, but we still wanted to give a little something back to our community. Don't expect this update to be big, although we hope you will enjoy it nonetheless.

Spend time with family, put on the cozy knitted sweater, make some hot chocolate, and if your mom dragged you to a family Christmas party that you didn't want to go to, hop on The Wild West and shoot some snowmen with your friends. And as always, thank you for your everlasting support!

Evil Snowmen [ ]

Returning from 2023. the Snowmen could be found scattered throughout snowy areas, standing in wait until players get too close or attack them. When angered, they attack with YellowBoy Rifles . Like the early builds of 2023's event, the rifle only renders while angered. Gun Part drop chances are far higher than 2023. According to Santa, the Snowmen hired during Christmas 2023 were hired from the Grinch. After they began protesting unfair labor conditions, Santa had players "melt" them. In retaliation, the Grinch put a bounty on Santa, and one of the Snowmen stole Santa's Lantern.

Elves [ ]

Four elves frequent Santa's Headquarters. Three of them are wandering NPCs , while Hodgkins the Elf is a static NPC who can be interacted with for a cup of Hot Cocoa.

Jalgruf the Elf can be found near Santa's fireplace, and wears the Dread Pirate beard.

Edgar the Elf can be found near one of the showcases.

Shane the Elf can be found near the Hot Cocoa Saloon, often sitting at the bar or walking around Jalgruf. He shares Sneaky Shane 's face and hairstyle, but lacks facial hair.

The wandering NPCs are protected, and cannot be killed. They are armed with Rednose Rifles rather than the Laser Cannons from 2021. They do not leave the headquarters, and Snowmen will not enter.

Hot Cocoa [ ]

Also referred to as Hot Chocolate , Hot Cocoa does not boost Health Regeneration when consumed, but it gives players the "Low Gravity" effect. The effect lasts for 60 seconds, during which players have a greatly increased jump, slow falling, reduced fall damage, and can fall far greater distances without being ragdolled. The effect seems to be gravity based, any items held will impact the jump height and fall speed. Larger items will significantly lower jump height, and increase the falling speed, as will more complex ones.

Hot Cocoa drops on death and cannot be stored in the Bank .

Santa [ ]

Players can talk to Santa in the Headquarters. He can also build Rednose Rifles if all three Frosty Gun pieces are brought to him. The dialogue options are a straight line, with players able to ask the next question to hear more exposition, or just say "Bye" at any point. Santa thanks the player for helping clear out the Snowmen the previous year, with Christmas happening on schedule. Santa then reveals that he had to pay a "hefty sum" to re-hire the Elves, who he calls "shrewd with the law". Additionally, Santa reveals that the Snowmen were "borrowed" from the Grinch without having paid him. Santa notes that this has resulted in a bounty on himself, placed by the Grinch, and an "agreeable loan" taken out from the Bronze City Bank .

Presents [ ]

Players may take one cookie from the table in the Headquarters. Further cookies may be obtained by killing Snowmen.

The Sled can be obtained in the workshop, but will likely be removed at the end of the event. A candy cane and the Santa Suit can be unwrapped from a box next to the Sled.

Discord Announcement [ ]

Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! I hope you are having a wonderful holiday morning. You're probably busy unboxing presents, but once that's done, we have a very small update to share with you.

This is a PARTIAL re-run of Christmas 2023: Santa's Request update. HOWEVER! Santa has a new home, there is a new limited time reward, and a continuation of the story of Santa's predicament.  Our attention has been wholly occupied by none other than, you guessed it, the Progression Update. But we also know that christmas is a time of joy, and we truly enjoy making these events for you all.

So, without further ado:

The snowmen are back for vengeance! And yet worse, now the dastardly Grinch has a bone to pick with Santa. If you wish to make the most your spoils of war, make sure to have a word with Santa before the end of this year. Don't forget, Christmas is about giving, and so for this event, we encourage you to share in the gifts and exchange the goodies that you find with the good folk of Bronze City!

Highlights Include:

🔸 Return of the Rednose Rifle

🔸 A new festive Lantern to find

🔸 Evil snowmen to destroy

🔸 Gifts near the tree

🔸 Hot chocolate to sip

🔸 And a questionably ethical Santa

I'm sorry we couldn't spend the time to add new enemies this year or a large event , although we hope you will enjoy it nonetheless.

We look towards 2025 with optimism as we intend to chip away at our aspirations for The Wild West. Expect more news and sneak peeks after the New Years. But until then... Spend time with your families! Take time to rest. As always, thank you for your everlasting support!

The whole team is working hard to make this new year one of our strongest yet

Merry Christmas!

2024 [ ]

In 2024, players could obtain 1 cookie from the tray in Santa's Headquarters, but similar to 2020 didn't let players "get greedy". They could also be dropped by Evil Snowmen .

2023 [ ]

In 2023, players could obtain 5 cookies from a present in Bronze City , as well as collecting varying amounts of cookies upon killing Evil Snowmen.

2021 [ ]

2021 offered a few ways to obtain cookies, being the present, gift shops, and snowmen. Under the giant tree in Bronze City , players could find a large gift box with their username on it. This could only be opened once, and gave ten cookies for free. Santa's Gift Shop and Krampus' Contraband both sold cookies on a plate for one of their respective currencies each. Evil Snowmen sometimes dropped between 3 and 7 cookies on death.

2020 [ ]

Both the El Saguaro and Bronze City saloons had plates of cookies. A maximum of three could be picked up free of charge. Attempting to take more would result in a red error message, one of which saying "Don't be greedy!"

Trivia [ ]

Despite being available in three events, the item only says "☃️ Christmas 2020 ". Cookies have a tendency to glitch under the map or surfaces when dropped by players.

Church [ ]

The Church is located in The Great Plains between Bronze City and Raider Canyons . It is a single room black and grey wooden church, with a stone foundation and orange stained glass windows. Two small upper balconies, an empty bell tower, a small pulpit with the Pump Organ , and many lamps on the ground and walls. Two small staircases go up to the balconies.

Next to it is Dead Man's Rest, a graveyard filled with gravestones. The Church is also one of several known locations with the Starboard Studios symbol, located underneath the spire in the empty bell tower.

The Church features a playable Organ , similar to the Calliope Steam Organ found on the Steamboat .

Dead Man's Rest [ ]

Located just north of Bronze City , this Great Plains location can be found next to the Church, and played a significant role in the development of The Wild West 's lore in Callahan’s Revenge and Undead Legends .

Before the Undead Legends revamp, the oldest gravestone dated to 1819 (Wayne Barentine), and the newest dated to 1914 (Marstons, a reference to the Red Dead Redemption series). Most, if not all, graves found in Dead Man's Rest were references to pop culture westerns, developers, or community managers and moderators. During the 2019 Halloween Update , a gate with a glowing symbol could be found here, acting as a way for the Wendigo to enter the West. During the 2021 Halloween Event , three Undead Skeletons wandered the graveyard.

In 2023, the Undead Legends event resculpted the entire area, changing marked gravestones to a variation of unmarked headstones, crosses, closed and opened coffins, and stone sarcophagi. Five of the marked graves referencing community staff and developers were moved to the Temple of the Egg . The only original graves to stay in the yard were those of the Martsons, Emmett Brown and Robert John Hudson .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Unmarked Grave was replaced by Arthur Manchester's grave. During Halloween 2019 , a gate appeared in Dead Man's Rest that spawned the Wendigo . The old graves of K. Hira, D. Sky, Emmett Brown, B. Wrath, M. Artheus, and B. Dog had flowers placed in front of them, some of which the colors represent aspects of their real-life counterpart. The Church features echo effects similar to caves like the Water Cavern and Forest Cavern . During the 2021 Halloween Event , Dead Man's Rest acted as a spawn point for Skeletons . Unlike Auburn Hall , the church doesn't feature a bell. The sound of the playing organ inside can be heard from outside the church by getting close to its walls. The light emanating from the two candles by the organ inside the old church left a light halo on the back wall, which could have been visible from the outside. The church is a faction territory. Overhead lights were added to the old chapel in version 3.8 . The stain glass windows cannot be broken. The Church has been referred to as the "Church of Starboardia" by Pastor Everett during the Undead Legends event. The fence is the same as the gate to the Forest of Bones . The fence has been removed, and the Church has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) .

Trivia [ ]

The Church and Dead Man's Rest are not based on any particular historical churches, though the style is typical of the era, featuring whitewashed wood, a tower and steeple, pews, a pulpit, and even a Pump Organ , which would be the historical choice for a smaller church on the frontier. Almost every grave used to be a reference to something, whether that be a movie, game, developer, or community member. Artheus had an exclusive blue top-hat in game, hence his blue flower. The grave of S.P. Horse is the only known grave to have ever had an animal buried with it.

Artheus7's blue top hat.


--- Cinematic_Mode ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Cinematic Mode is a UI option useful for taking clean screenshots or recording videos without on-screen distractions.

To access it, press Tab to open the main interface. From there, scroll to the bottom of the menu and look for the UI option . Clicking it will activate Cinematic Mode, hiding most HUD elements for a more immersive view.

When active, all User Interfaces and Menus are hidden, with the exception of [E] Interact prompts, the Camera Icon which toggles Cinematic, and Roblox's Chat and Menu Icons. A Starboard Studios watermark will appear on the bottom right corner of the screen, and can be toggled by clicking it. While in Cinematic Mode, players are unable to use shops, access their inventory, utilize crosshairs for aiming in third person, or view maps and store menus, among other UI-related functions.

Cinematic Mode has no dedicated keybind, and must be disabled by clicking the Camera Icon at the top left of the screen, found next to the Settings icon.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Using the scope of the Sharps Rifle or the Spitfire Revolver Sniper while in Cinematic Mode will make it so that the scope is zoomed in and the crosshair on the scope disappear. This incredibly useful for close up shots or when you want to pan the camera when recording a video. This also works with Binoculars . Cinematic Mode was added in Version 3.1 . Taking damage or ragdolling in cinematic mode will display some of the UI again. Cinematic Mode, in the Progression Update (4.0) , now has to be toggled through the main interface, using Tab.

Price

The Cleveland Bay has a brown coat and black mane and tail.

Similar to the Dutch Warmblood , this horse specializes in a single statistic: stamina. The Cleveland Bay has the highest stamina of all one-star horses, but has very poor speed and health. Pretty versatile, but terrible for fights. Essentially a better version of the Tersk for the same price.

Prior to Version 3.4 , this horse had one more bar of health than it does currently. It was one of the most useful horses that could be bought at its low price tag. Even after its health was reduced, this horse still holds up quite well.

Purchase Locations [ ]

The Cleveland Bay can be bought at Horse Stables in the following locations:

Windmill Camp Bronze City Outlaw's Perch Puerto Dorado


--- Climbing ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Climbing is a feature that enables players to ascend and descend certain designated surfaces. When climbing, the player's character enters a climbing animation, and their movement slightly changes. Players lose the ability to move sideways, and the only allowed movement is either up or down the surface. Additionally, players can jump off a surface they are climbing to stop climbing. Pressing [C] before or while climbing causes players to climb very slowly, as they are crouching. Pressing [C] again to stop crouching will fix this.

Climbing can be somewhat tricky, and the limited movement can make it disorienting. One of the best methods for players to use when climbing is to line their character up facing the exact direction towards the surface they want to climb.

There aren't many surfaces which utilize climbing, but the ones currently in the game are ladders and ropes. Descending from both ropes and ladders is very simple, as players in close proximity to a ladder or rope will automatically snap to it.

Ladders [ ]

Ladders are most commonly used to get into Forts via siege ladders. Ladders can also be found at the Quarry , Copper Gulch Mine , Howling Peak , Outlaw's Perch , Desert Mine , and Raider Canyons Mine .

Ropes [ ]

Ropes are mainly found in caves such as the Water Cavern , the Lake Cave , and the Forest Cavern .


--- Companies ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 3.9.3 .

Companies own and operate various businesses and suppliers throughout The Wild West .

They tend to have little to no impact on gameplay and lore. The companies also tend to change over time, with little explanation between versions. Older companies likely no longer "exist" within the game's history, having been removed for retroactive continuity.

They mainly exist as reasons why game features occur.

Contents

1 Railroads 2 Mines 3 Banking 4 Arms, Supplies, and Horses 5 Plantation 6 Shipping and Postal 7 Military 8 Miscellaneous

Railroads [ ]

All Trains are run by the Bronze Peak Railroad Company , who also own the Train Stations , Railways, associated Water Towers , and even presumably Bronze City 's Cattle Pens . With three iterations of Trains, Bronze Peak has been the only consistent railroad, and the only one that currently exists.

The Sheffield Velocipede Car Company was a real company which manufactured Velocipede Cars, which appear to have been purchased by Bronze Peak for track laying.

The second in-game Train system was primarily operated by the B.P.R.R. Co., but also included cars run by Northern Line (Which ran black Luxury Train Cars), Eastern Line (Which only ran a single baggage car on other companies' trains), Southern Line ( Mining Industries and Railroad Company running red freight, coal, and passenger trains), Western Line (Green passenger trains with some cargo and baggage, sometimes containing a couple southern line hopper cars), and the United States Military Railroad (Which ran a munitions and payroll armored car , as well as blue cargo and passenger cars with the Northern Line). It is unclear if these older companies were subsidiaries of the B.P.R.R., with separate names for the train's purposes, or if they simply no longer exist in the history of The Wild West .

Mines [ ]

Various mines operate throughout The Wild West , and while most appear to simply be derived from existing cave systems, there are notably industrialized mines.

Copper Hill Mining Company owns and operates Copper Gulch Mine , and is likely tied closely to Bronze City , the mine shafts and mining complex located throughout and on the opposite side of Copper Hill from the city.

Sinner's Canyon and The Quarry are also industrialized mines, though no signage shows who operates or works them. Sinner's Canyon Mine features some small shafts, a camp presumably for the workers, and a small steam engine for shunting around materials. The Quarry is a large open-excavation pit full of large blocks of limestone, and has various scaffolds, lifts, and ramps for removing both large blocks, and smaller amounts of material. Ownership has no indications, though both are fairly close to Puerto Dorado , and are likely unaffiliated with Copper Hill.

Banking [ ]

The Bronze Bank Company runs the item storage and retrieval system that players can use, accessible through the company's founding location of Bronze City Bank , found in Bronze City . They have also produced a series of chests which have been used to access their services within Fort Henry , Fort Spencer , and the Buried Library (during The Forest of Bones ). They have also partnered with Puerto Dorado's Post Office , which features a till for a "Bronze City Banking Agent".

Arms, Supplies, and Horses [ ]

Kaz Co. Firearms was first seen printed on supply crates in the Auction House , before later being revealed (by Sneaky Shane ) to also be running the Auctions. According to the Gun Store in Bronze City, the company was established in the city in 1889. They import or manufacture all of the weapons and items on Auction, and replacement of the Guns & Ammo with Kaz Co. Firearms' Guns, Pistols, Ammunition & Explosive Supplies may indicate that all Gun Stores are run by Kaz Co. Claus Gifting Co. provides gifting supplies through their facility in Buffalo Ridge .

Worthington runs Bronze City's General Store, replacing the classic General Store at the same time Kaz Co. replaced the Guns & Ammo . It is unlikely that the General Stores are a united company, as James Co. Supply runs Silvertown 's General Store.

R. J. Hudson established Hunt and Trade , and invented and produced TNT Charges and Detonators , with Hunt and Trade being a successful business, and explosives being Hudson's hobby and passion on the side.

Joe's Stables and Horses are a Horse and stable company located in Bronze City. They may also run El Establo in Puerto Dorado, and possibly Windmill Camp's Stable , as all three ranch hands have the exact same appearance, except for Windmill Camp's Joe, who wears an eyepatch. Outlaw's Perch has a stable, however it is not marked, and a different ranch hand operates it.

Plantation [ ]

Delores Callahan operates Delores' Ranch on the Plantation, and is the only known living Callahan. Callahan's Manor was established in 1830, and with it, likely the Plantation and Ranch as well. A wealthy plantation owning family, the business and grounds have remained within Callahan hands since. Notably, Delores' appearance in The Wild West appears to be Joe with hair, while her promotional depictions give her a different hat, hairstyle, face, and outfit. Leonard Callahan was the previous owner of the Plantation, and Delores' father.

Shipping and Postal [ ]

La Grande Steamboat is operated by the Robloxian Steam Packet Line , carrying cargo and gold from Puerto Dorado to the Swamp . The Seriema was never added, but would have been operated by the Western River Line , either a competitor or precursor to Robloxian. It is unclear if either are canonical companies, Western never making it into The Wild West , and Robloxian referencing Roblox itself.

Various Post Offices and Mailboxes imply that a Postal Service exists and operates. Mailboxes are marked as "U.S MAIL" implying that a form of USPS exists inside the game. Post Offices have no further markings or uses (except for the Bank in the Puerto Dorado Post Office ) beyond Mailbox access. From Sneak Peaks, it's implied that Post Offices will have safes that can be robbed in the future, possibly to upgrade skills .

Military [ ]

While the United States Army plays little to no role in The Wild West aside from running the robbable armored payroll and munition cars , and previously United States Military Rail Road passenger and cargo cars. Previous conflicts have left their mark in the game. Fort Henry and Fort Spencer are Civil War-era forts, and the Ruined Fort has similar construction, but appears to have been destroyed in a battle, likely with the Washte .

Miscellaneous [ ]

Saloons appear to operate independently. Henry Bros. Clothiers are a company of tailors running a shop in Bronze City. " Red " operated or owned various Junctions , Sawmills , and Furnaces .

Copper Gulch Mine Copper Hill Mining Co. Type Mining Location, Faction Territory Location The Great Plains Inhabitants None The Copper Gulch Mine is a mining complex owned by the Copper Hill Mining Company. It is comprised of large red buildings and mine shafts located in The Great Plains South-West of Bronze City . It is the closest mine to Bronze City and is full of common ore deposits such as Coal, Copper, and Zinc . The mine is generally considered to be one of the best places to mine for new and experienced players alike, due to its proximity to Bronze City. If you get lucky with gems, you can get up to $20,000 an hour.

Buildings and Structures [ ]

Copper Gulch Mine has three freestanding surface structures. One is a structure built to house the Sawmill , useful for Outlaws and Factions who wish not venture into cities or capture Forts . The second is a building with two rooms, a few tables and chairs, a painting, and a wooden desk. This room is the mine's office, where senior mine executives would work. The third building is the remainder of the complex. It houses many mine cart tracks, furnaces, and an engine. The building might have been use to smelt the ores and feed the coal into a hopper, for deposition into a Train car. It also has a Train Station as marked on the map , though the station is actually just a stop where the cars load up on fuel and gold. There are 2 stockpiles of coal along with small trenches of uneven ground outside of the mine.

Mine Description [ ]

The mine has 5 entrances. Two are for "Shaft No. 2", up by the top of the mine. One is for "Shaft No. 1", located near the sawmill at the bottom of the mine. One is for "Shaft No. 3", the entrance closest to Bronze City. The final entrance is the river that flows alongside Bronze City, which leads into the cavern part of the mine. Copper Gulch has a total of 9 Coal Deposits, 7 Copper Deposits, and 2 Zinc Deposits.

Of these, 5 Coal Deposits, 2 Copper Deposits, and both Zinc Deposits are found outside of the large cavern.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Copper Gulch Mine is owned or was made by "Copper Hill Mining Co." The Copper Gulch Mine was slightly updated and had its name changed from "The Mines" to the Copper Gulch Mine in the 2020 Egg Hunt . A sign post outside of Bronze City points towards this location. Trains often stop by the mines to refill their tenders. Copper Gulch Mine is one of three marked train stations. If an armored train passes by the mines, then the amount of Gold Bars in the vault will increase from 4 to 10. During the 2021 Christmas event , Copper Gulch was turned into Santa's Workshop. Santa set up his gift shop in the mining complex, where players could buy various trinkets using Nice Tokens. During the 2023 Christmas event , Santa's Workshop made a return, featuring Santa giving out a quest. The buildings in the mine resemble the mining complex buildings found in the town of Annesburg from Red Dead Redemption II . The building complex is a faction territory. It and The Quarry are the only territories that take at least two people to capture.

It and The Quarry are the only territories that take at least two people to capture.


--- Copper_Gulch_MineHistory ---

Starting as a rocky cave in a mountain, The Mine is one of the oldest locations in The Wild West . Located right next to Bronze City , it's been one of the most stable money making methods over the course of the game. Over time, the Mine has expanded and industrialized, most notably with the area becoming the Copper Gulch Mine we know today with the August Update. Previous facilities included a more simple cargo loading station, a train station for human passengers, rope suspension bridges, and a lot of dust.

Changelog [ ]

Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format.

05/09/2018: The Mine is a dusty and rocky "low-level" area to make cash, with one mineshaft. The outdoors also contained a removed Gold Deposit . The region text displays only "The Mine".

??/03/2019: The Southern Line Mining Industries station is likely added, and is used to double the amount of gold in U.S.M.R.R. Armored Trains . A suspension bridge between Copper Hill and the hill on the other side of the station is likely added at this time.

31/08/2019: The Mine is rebranded, modeled, and worked into Copper Gulch Mine. More mineshafts are available, and larger facilities and more varied buildings can be found.

21/09/2020: Bronze City Train Station is remodeled, and Copper Gulch Mine Station is most likely removed. A Sawmill is added around this time.

24/12/2021: Santa's Gift Shop takes over Copper Hill Mining Company's main processing facility, along with other holiday changes.

08/01/2022: Frozen Days is reverted.

25/9/2023: Version 3.8 ( Faction War) is released. Copper Gulch now becomes a faction territory.

The Copper Hill Mining Company owns and operates the Copper Gulch Mine . They also supply, fill, and run regular shipments of coal through the Bronze Peak Railroad Company 's Trains .

Major stockpiles can be seen near the railroad tracks, implying that these are loaded onto various hopper cars. They appear to have ties to the United States Military as well, seeing as when the Armored Train stops at Copper Gulch, they double the amount of payroll gold bars kept in the car.

History [ ]

Added in the August Update, along with the remodel of The Mine into Copper Gulch Mine , Copper Hill Mining Company replaced the previous Southern Line Mining Industries. No further information on operations, history, owners, or activity is known.

Trivia [ ]

The facilities at the Copper Gulch Mine were taken over by Santa's Gift Shop in the Frozen Days and Santa's Request event. Other industrially developed mines can be found as The Quarry and the Sinner's Canyon Mine . It is unclear if Copper Hill is involved with either.

The Red Bandanna (previously known as the "Hax Bandana) was "available" to players who glitched outside of the map to The Far Shore during one of the 3.4.20 updates. The Red Bandanna has since been made available to all, and a new Hax Bandana automatically awarded to everyone who grabbed the original, featuring black cloth with neon purple flames. The Scuba Helm and Jack O' Lantern Mask are the only "functional" cosmetics, having non-cosmetic effects. The Christmas Scarf does not go around the characters' necks, instead being a solid piece that clips through where the neck would be. Holster1 used to not render in the Cosmetics tab.

Cows are decorative Animals found in the Bronze City Cattle Pens .

Their only behaviors consist of walking in circles and occasionally laying down. Cows show damage markers and bleed when struck, but cannot be killed. It was implied that the Wendigo ate them and all of the Deer during the Forest of Bones event .

Three cows can be found in the pens located in Bronze City . Among them, two are gold and white, while the other one is black and white.

Trivia [ ]

Cows were temporarily removed during the 2020 Halloween Event . A sign was left that read, "Monsters ate our cows!" The monster mentioned here was implied to have been the Wendigo . Cows, Fish and Gerald are the only Animals that cannot be harmed. Some of the Cows can wander up the access ramps for the trains. After being pushed out by a player on horseback or walking out themselves, they get stuck outside of their pens. There is no easy way to get them back inside. If outside of their pens, Cows will almost always try to return to Bronze City. "A major bug causing a performance drop in Bronze City has been fixed, so hopefully you'll lag slightly less now. If you're wondering what the bug was... it was the cows... damn those cows." - Developers on a fixed bug involving cows. It is possible to get all the Cows out of their pens by pushing them near the fences using large horses like the Hungarian Halfbred or Tennessee Walking . Like all animals, Cows cannot drown when in water for extended periods of time. The pens have easy-access ramps to the trains, though trains do not have a separate cart for holding livestock.

Upon being equipped, the Lantern will hang off the player's hip and produce a small light source . This allows for the usage of other items or weapons while it is active. It can also be manually carried in one's hand.

The Lantern can greatly assist in Hunting or Mining at night or in caves, as the player will have a source of light even when they are performing other tasks. While it appears to have an advantage over the Torch , it still has its ups and downs.

The Lantern was first leaked by Tyridge77 , and was added a few days later in Version 3.2 . If the Items Visible on Back setting has been checked, the Lantern will stop appearing; ergo, no light for the user unless the item is held. The Jack o' Lantern hat from the 2020 Halloween Event produces a similar effect to the Lantern, emitting light in a small radius around the player. However, this hat takes up no inventory slots, allowing you to equip another item in your hotbar rather than equipping the Lantern.

Fanning [ ]

The Volcanic Pistols feature a unique fanning pattern. Unlike most other Fannable Guns , the accuracy decrease is fairly low, being similar to the model 3. Also unlike other fannables, the speed change is much less drastic. Most fannable weapons gain a far greater speed boost, often emptying the gun within a second. The Volcanic Pistols instead fire at a similar rate to their unfanned speed.  The Volcanic Pistol has the slowest fanned firerate of any weapon in the game, and is the only fannable non-revolving pistol (besides its cursed variant).

Doubles [ ]

Previously, it was possible to purchase or pick up multiple Volcanic Pistols at a time. Attempting to do so now meets players with a "You already own this item!" error message. This can be bypassed via Trading for both the Volcanic Pistol and its Cursed variant. Two Sidearm slots are available in the Hotbar , allowing up to two Volcanic Pistols of either variant to be equipped at once. Two Volcanic Pistols will share the same ammunition count. When one fires, it uses ammo in both. The same applies to two Cursed Volcanic Pistols. However, with one Cursed Volcanic and one Volcanic Pistol, a Player may successfully use two of the same pistol in their loadout.

Trivia [ ]

This is the second lever-action sidearm to be added to the game, the first being the Navy Revolver . The Volcanic Pistol is a sidearm version of the Volcanic Rifle featuring a handle, no stock, lower ammunition capacity, and a shorter barrel. The Volcanic was invented by Smith and Wesson, who were experimenting with a repeating pistol. It became a rifle, which lead to the creation of the Henry & then Winchester repeaters. A sneak peek showed Volcanic Pistols in Howling Peak Saloon , however once added, they could only be obtained in Fort Henry. Tomahawks could also previously be seen in Howling Peak's shops, but could not be purchased. In real life, there were two variants of the Volcanic pistol- the larger was known as the Navy, and fired .41 (No.2) Volcanic, while the smaller one was called the Pocket, and fired .31 (No.1) Volcanic. The one featured in-game appears to be a Navy. The Volcanic Pistols are the second weapon to have two separate versions, allowing players to use two of the same gun in combat. The first was the Dragoon Pistol and its Golden version.

The Dead End is a submerged passage containing three Gold deposits. Caution is advised, as a Bear resides inside the cavern. The chamber's small size and absence of ledges make escape and survival difficult. However, the water may impede the Bear's pursuit.

There is one place that is out of reach of the Bear, however. A small ledge on the left side offers safety to targeted players. Reaching this ledge requires either calling a Horse or executing a well-timed jump.

Trivia [ ]

The Dead End was one of the locations that you needed to visit for an "Explore" quest . Players could previously kill the Bear then place a Camp Tent over its spawn. When the Bear would respawn, it would be trapped inside the tent, making for easy grinding. This was patched in Version 3.4 . The Dead End used to have its own map indicator and region text.

Church [ ]

The Church is located in The Great Plains between Bronze City and Raider Canyons . It is a single room black and grey wooden church, with a stone foundation and orange stained glass windows. Two small upper balconies, an empty bell tower, a small pulpit with the Pump Organ , and many lamps on the ground and walls. Two small staircases go up to the balconies.

Next to it is Dead Man's Rest, a graveyard filled with gravestones. The Church is also one of several known locations with the Starboard Studios symbol, located underneath the spire in the empty bell tower.

The Church features a playable Organ , similar to the Calliope Steam Organ found on the Steamboat .

Dead Man's Rest [ ]

Located just north of Bronze City , this Great Plains location can be found next to the Church, and played a significant role in the development of The Wild West 's lore in Callahan’s Revenge and Undead Legends .

Before the Undead Legends revamp, the oldest gravestone dated to 1819 (Wayne Barentine), and the newest dated to 1914 (Marstons, a reference to the Red Dead Redemption series). Most, if not all, graves found in Dead Man's Rest were references to pop culture westerns, developers, or community managers and moderators. During the 2019 Halloween Update , a gate with a glowing symbol could be found here, acting as a way for the Wendigo to enter the West. During the 2021 Halloween Event , three Undead Skeletons wandered the graveyard.

In 2023, the Undead Legends event resculpted the entire area, changing marked gravestones to a variation of unmarked headstones, crosses, closed and opened coffins, and stone sarcophagi. Five of the marked graves referencing community staff and developers were moved to the Temple of the Egg . The only original graves to stay in the yard were those of the Martsons, Emmett Brown and Robert John Hudson .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Unmarked Grave was replaced by Arthur Manchester's grave. During Halloween 2019 , a gate appeared in Dead Man's Rest that spawned the Wendigo . The old graves of K. Hira, D. Sky, Emmett Brown, B. Wrath, M. Artheus, and B. Dog had flowers placed in front of them, some of which the colors represent aspects of their real-life counterpart. The Church features echo effects similar to caves like the Water Cavern and Forest Cavern . During the 2021 Halloween Event , Dead Man's Rest acted as a spawn point for Skeletons . Unlike Auburn Hall , the church doesn't feature a bell. The sound of the playing organ inside can be heard from outside the church by getting close to its walls. The light emanating from the two candles by the organ inside the old church left a light halo on the back wall, which could have been visible from the outside. The church is a faction territory. Overhead lights were added to the old chapel in version 3.8 . The stain glass windows cannot be broken. The Church has been referred to as the "Church of Starboardia" by Pastor Everett during the Undead Legends event. The fence is the same as the gate to the Forest of Bones . The fence has been removed, and the Church has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) .

--- Death_Messages ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Death Messages are short strings of text, often poking fun at the player, that fade into existence in the center of the player's screen when they die.

There are a few different death messages which are mostly kept in a comical tone. There is no correlation between methods of dying and receiving certain messages, they are simply chosen at random.

Death Message List [ ]

A list of all possible Death Messages to receive.

"You've yee'd your last haw" "You should see the doctor" "ripperoni" "You could be healthier" "You're super dead" "Ouch" "You got rekt" "To be continued..." "Your luck ran out."

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

When a player resets their character, they go straight to the spawn menu without dying, meaning they receive no death message in the process. The "Your luck ran out." message was added in Version 3.5 . Turning on Cinematic Mode makes death messages non-viewable. Some Death Messages feature small grammatical nuances that are unique to them. For example, "ripperoni" is the only death message not to start with a capital letter. "You should see the doctor" was originally "You should see a doctor". This was shown in an early test of death messages .

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

Deer will run if they notice a player, or take any damage. Accurate, high damage, low falloff weapons are the most reliable way to hunt Deer, especially if they are capable of dealing over 50 damage to the body. Deer antlers are not counted as part of the head, and tend to "catch" bullets aimed at the head, resulting in body damage, further complicating the use of weapons that deal less than 50 body damage. "Sniper" rifles or the Longbow are the most reliable weapons for hunting Deer, as they allow players to attack with high damage and accuracy from outside of the Deer's alert range, and do not require headshots to kill. Weapons that deal more than 25 damage and can be fired in quick succession may also be used, though rely on player speed, tracking, and aim, as once the first attack hits, the Deer will run, often unpredictably.

Deer are hard to hit in the head due to their habits, size, and antlers, as well as their large alert range. When not wandering, Deer can often be seen standing or laying in the grass, and don't turn around too much. While wandering, they move quickly, and stay wary of nearby players, often running directly away from them.

Deer Pelts are worth as much as Gator pelts and more than Bison pelts, making them quite good due to the ease of killing deers compared to those animals. Deer pelts are also a guaranteed drop on death.

Locations [ ]

Two Deer can be found in Bear Paw Valley . One spawns just outside of Fort Spencer . Another spawns just northwest of Red's Junction , sandwiched between Pinewood Hills and Bear Paw Valley.

Five Deer can be found in Tribal Forest . One spawns near Ashburn Prison Camp . Two spawn northwest of the Abandoned Tribal Camp , one near a Hunting Tower , and one slightly closer to the Camp, near a tree. Another spawns south of the Tribal Camp, near the entrance. The last one spawns west of Hunt and Trade .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Deer was temporarily removed during the 2020 Halloween Event , likely "eaten" by the Wendigo , which also ate Bronze City 's Cows . Another reason for them being removed during the event was likely to make obtaining Animal Bones and Animal Meat harder, both of which had a significant role during the event. Apart from items, deer head and antler trophies can be found in stores and buildings, while antlers can be found on the front of most trains . Antlers mounted on a train are traditionally from an animal that has been run over by that train. Deer do not have a swimming animation, and can be seen hovering over the surface of water if chased into it. Deer are the only normal killable animals that do not have a Legendary variant . At some point before the 3.1 Update , there was a small chance that  Deer would attempt to attack players, but not deal damage. With the first addition of the Deer Antlers drop, the item had an inventory model, and appeared as a light blue/grey/normal item. They also sold for $110, which would be increased to $150 upon the icon and name change breaking.

Delores' Ranch , also known as Callahan's Point and previously known as the Plantation , is a small region surrounded by Raider Canyons to the southwest, the Swamp and Tribal Forest to the south, the Highland Plains to the east, and the Great Desert and Highlands to the north.

As its name suggests, Delores' Ranch is owned and operated by none other than Delores Callahan , a pivotal figure in the game's lore over the past six or so years. It is one of the main spawn locations that both Citizens and Outlaws can access.

Buildings [ ]

Callahan's Ruined Manor [ ]

This pile of rubble was once the largest building in the region, and in its ashes still lie a storied history. Before it burned down, it was previously owned by Leonard and Katherin Callahan , who have since become the Wendigo and the Ghost . This building was full of hidden rooms and secrets, but it fell into disrepair after the Forest of Bones event and was subsequently boarded up. Players could still enter by breaking one of the many large windows or by going around the back, where a broken windowframe allowed access.

The manor was removed in Version 4.0 and replaced with charred ruins, which still emit smoke from time to time. Eventually, a new version of the manor with more performance-efficient parts will be built in the coming updates .

Delores' Stable [ ]

A large building that opens into a paddock, just northwest of the manor. This is where Delores Callahan can be found; she spends her time tending to horses in this building, and players can interact with her to buy new steeds. Delores' Stable is the only place that 3-star Horses can be purchased.

Ranch Town [ ]

Delores' Ranch features a significant ranch town, with a general store, a jail, and a tailor shop. Any player spawning at the ranch will find themselves here. Not pictured on this page are a few other NPC houses, where the NPCs that wander this area either spawn in at or respawn when killed.

General Store [ ]

A regular general store with a broken wagon laying on the side. It promises "premium salmon ", which has yet to appear in-game. The store used to be located closer to Raider Canyons, but was moved to the other side of the tracks in the Progression Update. A singular NPC mans the counter of this store during daylight hours, guarding a cash register that can be robbed for $175.

Marshal & County Jail [ ]

A small hut where outlaws captured at the plantation are sent. It has one available Sheriff post, making it the second Sheriff post in the game's history after Bronze City's Sheriff's Office and Jail . The building features a jail cell, a bounty board, a desk with the ability to turn yourself in and another desk in front of a shelf where two Lemat Revolvers , a Mule Shotgun and a Sharps Rifle sit. When not walking around the ranch, one Sheriff NPC usually sits lazily inside this building.

Callahan's Point Tailor [ ]

Located right next to the jail is a clothing store similar to that of Bronze City , that has no actual unique purpose. It has a few blank mannequins displayed in the windows and two fitting rooms. Unlike the other clothing store, this building does not feature a robbable cash register.

Callahan's Point Telegraph Office [ ]

A small building on the opposite side of the train tracks, with a cash safe and cash register inside. One NPC usually guards this building during daylight hours, but he can be coerced into opening both the register and the safe. Besides its robberies, this building does not serve any purpose, other than being a decoration.

Callahan's Point Station [ ]

Separated by the neighboring Telegraph Office by a massive water tank for passing trains, this long station is one of three marked train stations on the map. Its ticket office does not function and the register inside cannot be robbed, but trains often pass by and stop at this building, given that the tracks are set up correctly. These passing trains are perfect robbery targets for any enterprising Outlaw.

Architect's Domain [ ]

Located beside Delores' Ranch, this odd rock has the symbol carved into it, with strange structures lying underneath. It is inaccessible. Attempting to interact with the rock will result in the error message "Your identity does not grant you access".

Trivia [ ]

A small two-wheeled Wagon can be found outside on the northeast wall. It is most likely a small cart that would be used in the fields. The base of the chandelier inside of the stable seems to be a wagon wheel.

The ranchtown—and presumably the Plantation—were owned by Delores Callahan , after her parents Katherin Callahan and Leonard Callahan died in the events of Callahan's Revenge . The farmhouse previously found on the Ranch was much smaller, and was red instead of green. Although being called a gun store, nothing could be bought there. The Gun Shop was removed when the Ranch was updated to the Plantation . Delores' Ranch Stable is still on the Plantation grounds, but has been rotated about 90 degrees.

According to The Wild West Five Figure Pack, Delores Callahan worked with a Sheriff to capture Zachariah Henry . Some think that Delores Callahan is the Mysterious Traveler who summoned Leonard Callahan from the Forest of Bones , but this is unlikely as both were in their respective locations at the same time. Before Callahan's Manor was updated to its current form, it was a smaller red farmhouse owned by Delores, located on Delores' Ranch . Delores is often pictured with the Lochke Revolver . It is presumed that Delores gave part of her inheritance to a friend, who buried it underneath the giant water tanker at the Callahan's Point station.

Demon Hunter Carter , also known as " Carter ", is one of the many Undead Mini-bosses added with the Undead Legends event.

While alive, he was Demon Hunter Jane 's partner, and "the best there ever was." Together with Jane, he tracked Wendigo sightings until one of them killed him. Before being killed by demons, he also had time to appear on various game thumbnails and icons, first appearing in 3.2's Forts & Gatling Guns promotional images. The same image was reused for 3.3.1's post- Christmas 2020 "Free to Play" revert. He would also reappear for 3.6.1/ Halloween 2022 's promotional images, shown dual wielding his shotguns.

After being accidentally resurrected by Dr. Lazarus and his Electro-Resurgence Engine, he returned as an Undead Mini-boss. Spawning among the other Undead during the event's manufactured thunderstorms, he will attack Wendigo Cultists , " The First Lady ", Dr. Lazarus, Demon Hunter Jane, and any players in sight. He tries to stay within close range of his target, and uses his Occult Mule at all ranges. In closer ranges, he may switch to his Occult Sawed Off , especially if his Mule runs out of ammunition. At very close ranges, he forgoes the shotguns, and instead uses his Occult Blade .

When killed, he sometimes drops several Occult Blades at once, and has a far higher chance to do so compared to Jane. He also has a rare chance of dropping the Flood Lantern . He may also have a chance of unlocking the Demon Hunter outfit or Zombie Hunter hat when killed, if the player has not already obtained them.

Every appearance of Carter in a thumbnail or icon shows him dual wielding a sidearm and primary of the same set. The primary is always carried in his left hand, the sidearm in his right.

Jane , also known as Demon Hunter Jane , was a Demon Hunter who wandered around the map during the 2023 Halloween event and the 2024 Halloween event , killing undead and the occasional Wendigo if she encountered it.

Contents

1 Characteristics 2 Behavior 3 Dialogue 4 Gallery 5 Trivia

Characteristics [ ]

Jane is a Demon Hunter who hunts Wendigos. Her partner, Carter , was killed by one. She wears the Demon Hunter outfit and wields an Occult Mule , Peacekeeper Revolver , and Occult Blade .

Behavior [ ]

During the event, Jane wandered around Raider Canyons , The Plantation , Bronze City , Pinewood Hills and the Swamp . She would attempt to eliminate any Undead she came across, including the Skin Walker and Wendigo . Any Wendigo Cultist would be met with the same treatment, as would players wearing the Cultist outfit or the Wendigo Hat. Aliens would also attack her if their paths crossed.

Jane could be talked to, and offered the player advice on where to go during the event. Players who gave her the Wendigo Ribs would be rewarded with the Demon Hunter outfit, as well as the Occult Mule .

Attacking Jane, or approaching her after defeating her in the past, or while wearing Cultist clothing would draw her ire, with Players fulfilling any of these conditions being attacked on sight. Players who successfully defeated her had would be granted one Occult Sawed Off , regardless of if they had one from the year before already or not, as well as the Demon Hunter outfit if it hadn't already been unlocked through bringing her the Wendigo Ribs or killing Carter. On death, she also had a very low chance of dropping her Occult Blade.

Trivia [ ]

Jane instantly attacked players wearing the Wendigo Mask. Jane cannot be lassoed.


--- Desert_Mine ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Desert Quarry The main entrance to the Desert Mine. Type Sublocation, Mine Location The Great Desert The Desert Quarry (formerly the Desert Mine ) is a mining spot found in the Great Desert . The mine has three entrances: one is a shaft found in the Desert, one is a ladder on the north side of a small camp in Bear Paw Valley , and the Raider Canyons Mine connects through a tunnel.

Desert Quarry

Type

Location

The mine contains 1 Copper Deposit, 3 Iron Deposits, and 1 Silver Vein. The Iron Deposits in the middle of the tunnel that branches off of the main shaft, connecting to Raider Canyons Mine. The Copper and Silver deposits and vein are at the west end of a narrow rock bridge. Overlooking the ore and rock bridge are the partially excavated ruins of a limestone or adobe building. They can be accessed via a ladder and scaffolding built up to them, and act as a shortcut through the mine.

A crevice can be found directly underneath the rock bridge. This crevice is home to a large school of Geralds , mythical carnivorous fish that enjoy eating players who enter their waters. Don't fall down unless you want to be a sacrifice.

History [ ]

The Desert Mine was added in Version 3.1 , along with The Great Desert. In Version 3.5, the DeLorean was added. By entering the mine from the Great Desert entrance, a small tunnel is visible on the right. The DeLorean was in a small room at the end of this tunnel. Many ores were removed or changed during the mining mini-update on 6/9/2023. In Version 4.0, it was renamed "Desert Quarry", and connected to the Raider Canyons Mine through a tunnel. A Silver Vein was added where the Silver Deposit was.

Trivia [ ]

The area contains more Geralds than any other area on the map. You can lasso an Outlaw or enemy, bring them down to the mine, drop them into the pool of Geralds, and watch as the school devours them. But be careful with your sacrifices, as they can escape by jumping onto the steep rocks and climb back up if they are lucky. The DeLorean is hidden within the mine, accompanied by repair instructions. This car is a reference to the film Back to the Future Part III. It is possible for the player to earn anywhere from $1050 - $5800 if they are to mine all the ores inside the cave. During the 2022 Halloween Event , players were able to pick up a Jack O' Lantern mask that was next to the DeLorean.

TNT Charge: Gun Stores

The TNT Charge has a very large blast radius with high damage, inflicting lethal damage for anything standing relatively close to the charge when it explodes. TNT can be used to set traps, thanks to its ability to manually activate it, although it does need to be connected to the Detonator to be set off.

Detonators generate an electromagnetic charge, which is then transferred through the wire to the TNT's blasting caps, causing the large bundle of explosives to ignite. Unlike most other Camp Items, Consumable, and Weapons, the Detonator must be found . TNT Charges can be bought at Gun Shops or the Hunt and Trade for $120 per charge.

When purchased, TNT charges stack to 4. This makes buying them in bulk very feasible. Both the Detonator and TNT charges can be placed on most terrain types and can be rather far away from each other, which can make for more elaborate traps.

Detonator Quest [ ]

Purchase Dynamite from any Gun Store (or an Explosive Arrow at the Black Market ). Go to Dead Man's Rest and blow up Robert John Hudson 's gravestone. This will crack the grave. Take the Key from the cracked headstone. Go behind the Hunt and Trade in Tribal Forest , and open Hudson's basement at the back of the house. Walk down, and claim the reward on the table.

Trivia [ ]

Prior to Version 4.0, Hudson's Key and the Detonator could be obtained multiple times, as long as all extras were in the bank storage. These items can only be collected if they aren't already in a player's inventory. The Detonator quest was added in the Callahan's Revenge event. TNT was invented in 1863 as a yellow dye, and was first officially used as an explosive in 1891. The Detonator wasn't invented until 1876 in real life, either. Hudson's creation is almost three decades ahead of his time (at least!), making the man a serious inventor. There used to be a will sitting next to the Detonator. A static version of the detonator can be seen at faction territories , which can be used to light the signal cannon and start a raid. A video posted by tyridge77 featuring the old explosion can be found here .

The State of The Wild West

Use the header link to view the full article on medium.com

I wanted to write a little article/dev blog over the current state of our main project, due to rumors that we’re no longer working on the game or other speculation, as well as to provide transparency about the game and starboard’s future.

Some of the blog is a bit technical and might not appeal to many of our players, but I’m an engineer by profession so bear with me

Where's the updates/What's taking so long?

This is both a hard and easy question to answer. The Wild West was effectively our first game. We barely knew what we were doing and the game is extremely ambitious. When it blew up, we were essentially being forced to play catch-up for years as a small team. Managing (and dealing with bad apples) in a community this large can be tough for a small team of a few indies that just want to have fun making games. We had to deal with this while juggling trying to deliver content that was way out of scope with what we could deliver at that point in time, usually due to frustrating roblox engine limitations/constraints(which can be very discouraging!). Our mental health suffered and we had a dark couple years because of all of this as a studio that we’re just recently recovering from.

The main reason The Wild West has been in such a drought the last couple years though is we’ve been in something in games/software known as a Deep Branch.

The game we’ve envisioned and been trying to build, roblox doesn’t really support out of the box with a lot of good tooling or systems. This means we have a lot of “Custom” stuff in this game.

As an example, we’ve recently been wrapping up a PathfindingService replacement that works the same as roblox’s(automatic navmesh generation), but is generally faster and doesn’t break all the time like roblox’s has for us. We were held back the last year pretty much by that alone because one of the big things we’re adding to the game are NPCs, and with the world complexity we have and the amount of NPCs we want — we couldn’t use roblox’s pathfinding. The 2023 halloween event was a nightmare for us because zombies would stand around doing nothing for eons while waiting for roblox to compute a path or failing to do so.

See full article for images

This is just one example though, our game is full of custom systems like this. In many ways it’s a massive tech demo that ended up turning into a game too.

Due to all of the systems we have to build or replace all the time to try and keep our codebase optimized and be able to get to the final step of actually delivering content, the last couple years our current development build(branch) of The Wild West has been significantly different than the live version that you can play today. This means, until that branch is live(the progression update), it’s been almost impossible to deliver frequent content updates alongside that.

Delivering content to the live game while in a years deep development branch is hard because:

When you add a new feature to the live branch, you have to add it back into the dev branch(so it remains in the game in the future) When the dev branch is years deep into development and a lot of parts of the codebase don’t even remotely match up, this is usually extremely difficult and time consuming. It means you effectively have to create the thing twice in two different games. Even things as simple as new items can be hard to back-port The longer we spend working on new systems or changing the game’s codebase significantly without updating, this issue snowballs. In our case it snowballed for years to the point where updating the live game was impossible

We understand why this happened and we’ll do our best to avoid it in the future. Because it’s as frustrating for us as it is to our community. Unfortunately, a lot of the things we work on at starboard are very ambitious so this was partially unavoidable, but we’ll take steps moving forward to ensure it doesn’t happen to this extent again. Future projects don’t have such a messy codebase, so it’ll be much easier to prevent this from the start.

The Roadmap

Here’s the current roadmap for the main projects we’re currently working on in TWW

Progression Update + NPCs

Adds progression skills to the game with rewards, content streaming for better performance and faster load times, and populates the once vacant map with reactive, scheduled, and meaningful NPCs(plus a lot of other various goodies and improvements) 90% done, mid November estimated release

Fishing

Adds the fishing skill to the game ~ 80% done, Early to mid December estimated release

Highlands Biome

Adds the last large biome to the game ~ 80% done, Early to mid December estimated release

Wagons

Adds stagecoaches and other types of wagons to the game ~50% done, late December to Mid January estimated release

Base Building

Adds buildable player homes to the game Unknown release date at this time. Too focused on other things first

Wildlife Overhaul

Rework the wildlife system from the ground up, allowing better performance and much more wildlife to exist in the world as well as greatly improved AI Reintroduction of snakes!

The Future of Starboard

We have a team of extremely talented, creative, and hard working game developers — and we don’t want The Wild West to be all our studio is known for.

We’ve been excited to share new projects with you, and we’ve been learning a lot from the mistakes of our past as well as building tools the last few years to accelerate open world game creation significantly. What might have taken us multiple months to craft a few years ago now only takes us a week.

After we deliver most of what we’ve promised, we’re going to take a break from the game and pursue some new ideas. The Wild West won’t be discontinued at this point, but it’ll be put more into maintenance mode while we work on new games

We’re much better developers, business owners, and game designers than when we started The Wild West. And with future games, we’ll have a better production workflow to speed up updates and diminish a lot of the mistakes we made with our current(half antiquated) codebase.

We’ll also try to have much better community transparency in the future. It’s been difficult for this project, because it’s hard to explain to players sometimes how we can be working nonstop for years yet release very little. It’s disheartening to share, and we’re a small team of friends that are still learning how to do everything and provide that transparency in the right way. I hope I’ve at least cleared that up a bit.

Thanks for tuning in and the continued support!

Devblog 9

INTRODUCTION

Hey everyone, we're back with another developer blog! It's been awhile, and while we've been pretty silent lately, we are still working on the game.

The game's next update will be the 4.0 Progression Update, which includes an immeasurable number of changes and new features. We've talked about a lot of them already, but here's a bit of new information from our recent works:

BEARPAW VALLEY

As you may have seen and deduced from images in #⁠sneak-peeks, the Bearpaw valley region and Fort Spencer area is getting a revamp! The revamp includes a somewhat expanded forest area, a new waterfall, new ore, more caves, mushrooms, and +200% more bear. Here are some pics:

PROGRESSION SKILLS & REWARDS

Progression will be launching with the following list of skills available. Each skill comes with a perk which gets stronger as you level up. Expect each skill on average to have 1-4 new guns as well as items, perks and cosmetics to earn.

Mining

🔸 Mine to unlock new Pickaxe Tiers and larger ore veins.

Hunting

🔸 Rewards scoped weapons and traps.

Logging

🔸 Unlocks new axes and improves their viability in combat.

Exploration

🔸 Rewards new cosmetics and better agility.

Justice

🔸 Stopping criminals rewards new weapons and tools for lawmen.

Outlaw

🔸 Being an outlaw and robbery rewards new weapons and a lockpicking skill.

Militia

🔸 Rewards explosives and war related equipment.

Primaries

🔸 Level up by being accurate with your primary weapon slot, rewards new special weapons and cosmetics.

Sidearms

🔸 Level up by being accurate with your secondaries, rewards new special weapons and cosmetics.

Doctor

🔸 A special gamepass-only skill, unlocks new items and cosmetics for owners of the Doctor Gamepass.

Hitman

🔸 A special gamepass-only skill, unlocks new items and cosmetics for owners of the Hitman Gamepass.

STREAMING ENABLED

Our programmers have recently been hard at work converting the game's code to support Streaming Enabled , a Roblox feature which massively improves load times and overall performance. This has caused a number of issues and bugs which we are currently working on finding and fixing. The end result will mean much much faster load times!

This image was hard to capture because the game loads so fast now!

BRONZE 4.0 UPDATE

Our builders are currently in the process of finalizing the Bronze City 4.0 update, which includes a reworked Sheriff's office, Saloon, and Bank! Each location will have new gameplay mechanics and will better support both players and NPCs going forward. All stores will also now be robbable.

NPCs

The NPC system which has been teased in several holiday events is finally coming to the game permanently, and massively expanded! NPCs, including store clerks, will now be robbable, shootable, and talk! There will be several bandit camps across the map which groups of lawmen can raid for loot and experience. Outlaw players may also be able to hide in these camps, as the NPCs might not be hostile towards you. Causing chaos in Bronze will also be significantly harder now, as there are Sheriff NPCs which patrol the greater Bronze region, and they put up a fight.

NEW HEISTS & EVENTS

This one is still in early stages, but we want to add more events and player driven scenarios to the world. One such scenario which is currently being designed involves a feud between two Robber Barons. Outlaws will be tasked with stealing an industrial tractor and its contents from a wealthy industrialist. The lawmen have to put a stop to this robbery and escort the tractor to its intended destination on the other side of the map.

LAST WORDS

And that's it for this devblog! It has been a long ride, and we appreciate everyone's patience, we are a small team and most of us do this as a hobby project rather than a full time job. And don't worry, there's a whole boat load of changes and features which I haven't covered in this devblog, as it would simply be far too long. Some other features in Progression Update include: new shop UI, new HUD, new sidebar, new map locations, new robbery spots, tons and tons of new items, new NPCs, quests, daily quests, a tutorial questline, revamped assets, balance changes, price changes, gamepass upgrades and more!

Sneaky Shane will be seeing you!

Devblog 8: Community FAQ

Hey everyone,

It's been awhile since our last devblog and I’m sure you’ve all got plenty of questions about the state of the game’s development. I’ll be splitting this devblog into both a FAQ to answer your questions as well as an update on what we’ve been working on. Without further ado, here’s Devblog #8!

Q: Why is this update taking so long?

A: It's been a difficult year for our studio with a lot of setbacks and a lack of availability. Right now our team is only able to work at about 30% of what we used to be able to do. Some of our team have taken a leave of absence from the game’s development. This has made it very difficult for us to finish this update.

Q: When Update

A: As always I sadly cannot give a time estimate, but I can say that we are getting close! Right now what’s preventing us from updating is a lot of work related to hooking up Quests and Perks into the game’s code, as well as providing the rewards for leveling up.

Q: Why don’t the developers just release smaller updates every month?

A: The reason why we can’t release smaller updates is that a lot of the content we’re creating right now is dependent on progression being added first. After major changes to the game such as building and progression are added we plan on changing the pace of updates to a monthly schedule rather than quarterly or yearly.

Q: Are wagons still coming?

A: We don’t have any specific plans on adding wagons at the moment due to a lack of available developers to work on the feature, as well as some technical issues we ran into while attempting to implement them. If we do add them, it’ll be during the building update.

Q: Where is the building update?

A: Right now we’re focused on finishing the progression update since that content will tie into the building update, so we can’t continue on building until after we’ve added progression. The building update will be the next update after progression.

Q: Is The Wild West going to be added to Console or Mobile?

A: Right now we don’t plan on adding Console support for TWW, however, we are interested in adding The Wild West to mobile devices. I can’t say for sure when this would happen, but it's something we are continuing to work towards.

Q: What changes are coming to combat?

A: This is a commonly asked question as quick switching and other meta strategies are very controversial in the community. We’re making some changes to how movement and melee will work in the next update (more about that below). As for quick switching, no promises but we plan on adjusting the way players switch items. We will be looking at feedback very closely when these changes go live.

Q: Will the highlands be in the next update?

A: No, the highlands biome will be added with the building update.

What have the developers been working on?

RedTrain has been working on adding our latest and greatest train as well as a whole bunch of new buildings in Callahan’s Estate and Bronze.

AntiBoomz has been coding and implementing RedTrain’s revamped train system as well as fixing bugs and performance issues.

nurokoi has been busy with implementing new gameplay features such as a melee rework, coding UI functionality, adding new items, and continuing their work on progression and quests.

Kazuhira (that's me) has been working on animating and implementing new items, revamping some existing environment biomes, updating props, creating new UI, and making gameplay balance changes.

Astranox is our product manager and has been helping keep everything organized and on-track and implementing backend features for progression.

Tasogare , our latest hire, has been modeling new assets for upcoming game features.

To finish off this devblog and Q&A here are some of the changes we’re implementing right now:

NEW TRAIN SYSTEM

The new train system will allow players to halt trains, change their route, and finally travel to Puerto Dorado!

NEW ROBBERY MECHANICS

We’re adding tons of new locations across the map for Outlaws to rob! This will tie into progression and be the main method for outlaws to level up. We’re also revamping the Bronze bank to have more interesting robbery mechanics.

NEW MELEE SYSTEM

We’re adding new melee weapons such as machetes, axes, and swords which will have swings and blocks. The stamina system is also being revamped to support melee weapons, more movement (more rolling), and sniping.

NEW COSMETICS AND ITEMS

We’re adding a ton of new items and cosmetics. New beards, faces, hats, and clothing for each skill will be obtainable by leveling up. Each skill will also have at least one new gun and plenty of other new items to unlock as well.

ENVIRONMENT REVAMPS

Callahan’s Estate has received a revamp and now acts as a small farming town! Pinewood Hills has also received a massive overhaul with many props being updated.

That concludes this developer blog. As always, thank you everyone for your continued support, you helped make this game possible!

Devblog 7: Progress

Hey everyone, Its been awhile, but I'm back with another devblog! I'm sure you've all got a lot of questions, I'll try to answer them as best as I can. Without further ado:

WHAT THE DEVS DOIN

I'd firstly like to apologize for how quiet we've been lately, I'm sure you all know that the world is pretty crazy right now and our personal lives have been no exception to that rule. 
Here's a list of (most) of the things each developer has been working on for The Wild West:

AntiBoomz has been chipping away at the final steps to the Building Update and creating fun new features related to building. AntiBoomz has recently implemented a free-place system for building and a fence system!

tyridge77 hasn't been able to work on The Wild West at the moment due to other obligations, but he will be returning in the coming months to work full time again.

nurokoi has been creating new items and working on the fabled Progression Update . They have also been working on quality of life improvements.

RedTrain has been working on renovating Callahan's (now Delores') Manor and its surrounding areas. Expect a new lively area with more things to do!

Kazuhira (thats me) has been working on new content such as player items, building items, new UI for progression and other features, new effects and some other things.

Q&A ON PROGRESSION

Since we are getting closer to being able to release Progression I think its about time we answered some of your most asked questions about how this will work.

Q: How will you earn XP?

A: XP will be earned from completing quests and accomplishing impressive tasks in game (such as robbing a train, or finding a diamond). Just simply killing won't earn you XP.

Q: What skills will there be on launch?

A: At the moment we plan for 9 skills. They are: Justice, Outlaw, Mining, Hunting, Logging, Primary, Sidearms, Brawling and Militia. These are entirely subject to change, and more will be added in follow-up updates.

Q: How many levels are there?

A: You can level-up infinitely per each skill, but rewards stop after level 100. Levels also get increasing difficult to gain after 100.

Q: How will quests work?

A: There is a tutorial series of quests which will reward starter cash for new players. Any player can complete these, but they will only show once. Afterwards, players will be given daily quests and weekly quests, with weekly quests being more difficult and rewarding more.

Please keep in mind all these values are temporary and subject to change.

Q: What rewards will we get?

A: Skills will have milestones which give various rewards such as unique perks, clothing, hats, weapon variants (see sneak-peeks) and consumable items such as grenades or special ammmo.

OTHER NEW THINGS

We're adding a couple other quality of life features and new things to the game hopefully soon:

We've decided to add the functionality to trade cash between players. This will be limited to prevent abuse. We're adding this because when building is added there will be a large economy for buying and selling items.

In response to the increased value of player accounts, and the risk of having your account hacked (please read server-news PSAs on account safety!) we are adding a PIN system for increased account security.

We are also planning on adding Codes to the game, don't worry they won't be overpowered. Codes will be created for YouTubers, on some Twitter posts, and for some exclusive holiday & game events.

WHAT IS THE NEXT UPDATE?

The next update will most likely include Progression, new items, all the items and cosmetics associated with Progression, Callahan Manor revamp, new UI and trading & security improvements. As of right now we don't have an ETA on when this will all be done, but we're working as fast as we can! This is a lot of content and work for a small team. Thanks for the patience everyone.

COMMUNITY DISCORD

And lastly, a short update on the ongoings of the community Discord. We have moved the server over to an official Starboard Studios holding account rather than a personal developer account. This will not affect the server; game-news and sneak-peeks will still be posted.

That concludes this developer blog! As always, thank you all, we appreciate all of the support, you help make this game possible.

Devblog 6: An Open Letter

Hey everyone,

Many of you may have seen the sneak-peeks I’ve been posting lately, that’s just some of the work I’ve been doing, we have much more to come! You’re probably thinking “Where have the devs been? Where’s the update?”. Let me answer those for you:

WHERE HAVE THE DEVS BEEN?

To best answer this question, I will shotgun through the tasks that our team has been working on ever since the Auction House update.

@AntiBoomz  has been diligently working away at a very complex Building system, while I can’t give a release date, I can say building is WORKING (in our dev-testing sessions), so we’re getting closer each day.

@Sky has been non-stop improving the game with quality of life, balancing patches and security improvements as well as coding the new guns you’ve seen in sneak-peeks as well as starting work on progression. She’s also our dedicated community manager and leads our game moderation effort!

@nuro, our newest team member, has been working on some very interesting new features such as progression and other quality of life additions! Wish them a warm welcome when you see them everyone.

@RedTrain has been working on some new buildings, updating our train model and adding a few new secret areas! He’s also working with a separate team of contributors on the Highlands, that team will be announced after the Highlands update is live.

@Kazuhira (that's me) has been working on many of the sneak-peeks you have seen and more: new guns, new items, new UI such as the Progression menu, some new animations, new areas such as the highlands and some special stuff for the Halloween update!

TELL US MORE ABOUT PROGRESSION

Progression is both a revamp of our existing Quest system (which is very old) and introducing a new system, the Skill system. There are many skills in The Wild West, and don’t worry, you’ll be able to master every single one if you so desire.

Leveling up your skills will provide rewards such as perks (perks will not give you a major advantage in PvP), new exclusive items and of course some sweet Bucks! As you play you will naturally accumulate XP (experience) based on what type of activities you do.

However, the fastest way to level up your skills will be by completing Quests. Quests are being expanded and updated to include more interesting activities and better rewards!

WHAT’S THE NEXT UPDATE?

The next update will be our yearly Halloween update. The next normally-scheduled update is Progression, but please keep in mind that things can change so this is not guaranteed and the update schedule may swap.

The Wild West is coming close to its third Halloween update (I can’t believe it!) and hopefully this year’s update lives up to all of your expectations. Looking far into the future I believe The Wild West still hasn’t reached its golden period just yet, that’s hopefully coming soon with the release of building.

As for other projects, the past several months our team has focused entirely on The Wild West due to limited staff availability and the goal of prioritizing the release of existing planned updates. Due to this, The Wild Seas will most likely be delayed, expect more information about this project in 2022.

Building is coming along nicely!

That concludes this developer blog. As always, thank you all for your continued support, your enjoyment of our game has been a foundation for our livelihoods and I am extremely grateful to all of you.

Devblog 5: Esoteric Arsenal

YEEEEEEEHHHAAAAAWWWWW we're back with more devblogs folks! I know we're all just itching for the next update so let's jump right into it- THIS IS A DEVBLOG, NOT AN UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT. Without further ado, here's the state of The Wild West development: BUILDING - IN PROGRESS We're still steadily working on building! Progress has been made, but we're still working on some technical challenges which are preventing us from releasing it right now. Not this update, but hopefully the next! Enjoy this breathtaking view of a house which was entirely player built.

NEW GUNS

Our next update will include a whopping NINE new guns! Better yet, these guns aren't your run of the mill Peacekeepers either. These are some of the rarest, most unique firearms available in The Wild West, with each gun having its own quirk.

NEW SHOP

A mysterious new businessman has opened shop in Howling Peak, expect him to sell rare and bizarre items and weapons. His wares are quite limited though and may not always be for sale!

TOWN CHANGES

Howling Peak and Puerto Dorado have both received updates and should be a bit livelier now (and with more secrets)!

QUALITY OF LIFE

We've made a bunch of changes to the game's meta that should improve your game experience. Some examples include a new emote menu (and possibly more emotes coming as well!), new item rarity indicators and some minor weapon balance tweaks.

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

We're keeping this one a secret for now, but it will be added next update!

That concludes this developer blog! As always, thank you all for your continued support, this game only exists because of YOU. As a last note, our Roblox Toys recently released on Amazon and in-stores, buying these supports us! (And we think they're pretty cool).

2021 Roadmap

Developer Blog 4: Forts & Fun

FISHING

Still being worked on, not this update but hopefully next. Move along citizen.

LEADERBOARDS

We are adding an all-time tracker for Donations so that we can honor our largest funders.

SAWMILLS

Yep, you can now turn your logs into planks! Planks will be a crucial material for building in the future, but right now the only thing they're used for is repairing the Forts when you blow them up.

FORTS

By far our largest project since last update, Forts are secure __cpLocations which factions (or a player) can capture and hold. Forts provide unique bonuses such as an outlaw turn-in point, a shared storage container and a shop which sells unique items. To capture a fort, you or your faction must be within the fort walls and have the majority population. After holding a fort for long enough, it will become yours.

GATLING GUNS

IS THAT A GATLING GUN? Yes it is... For now Gatling Guns will be exclusive to forts, and will require unique ammo in order to fire. Extremely overpowered? Yes.

NEW ITEMS

We're working on a few new items and weapons, but we're keeping those secret for now.

That concludes this developer blog, as always thank you so much for your continued support.

Developer Blog 3: Options & QoL

IN GAME CHANGELOG

We made a new menu that shows the change history of all future updates, you'll be able to access this in-game at any time.

OPTIONS MENU

The time has come, I give you back your frames in full... We decided to go all in and make an options menu to change or disable some of the laggiest features in our game (such as rain and shadows). This should SIGNIFICANTLY improve your fps if you are on a low end device.

CINEMATIC MODE

YouTubers and content creators rejoice! We added cinematic mode, which disables all UI and enables a slight screen vignette for that aesthetic feel.

PERFORMANCE & BUGS

We fixed a few more performance issues and some bugs, this is a pretty standard process but we focused on it a little bit more this week. The more bugs we fix the closer we get to releasing the update!

Developer Blog 2: Fighting and Lag Cows

This week we focused on improving combat and performance.

GUNS & RECOIL CHANGES

We replaced our old recoil system with a newer system that's a lot smoother. Weapons now bounce up and left or right somewhat randomly based on the gun. This is a big change to PvP and we will adjust it as necessary. The muzzle flash, smoke and projectile hit effects for all guns have been updated as well as the sound effects for most weapons.

ITEMS AND HOLSTERS

Due to popular demand we've made it so players can see your equipped items on your character. When equipping weapons your character will take a moment to reach for his gun, this is a PvP balancing feature.

BRAWLING

With our focus on PvP this week, we thought what better way than to add a new method of fighting: brawling. Yup, you will finally be able to bring a fist to a gunfight. You will be able to punch and block punches, both of which require stamina to do. Run out of Stamina and the next time you take a hit you'll be hitting the floor.

PERFORMANCE

A major bug causing a performance drop in Bronze City has been fixed, so hopefully you'll lag slightly less now. 
If you're wondering what the bug was... it was the cows... damn those cows. Performance remains one of our highest priorities and we plan on further improvements next update.

Developer Blog 1: Where Are You?

The last few months have been nothing but silence from us, and for that we’re very sorry. With everything going on in the world, and some issues with motivation and depression, we’ve been a bit occupied. We’re still working on updates for The Wild West, and in no way have we abandoned our most successful project ever. I want to answer a few questions, then get to the bulk of this blog.

An answer to “where’s the update?”

Answer: The update has taken this long because we’ve run into a lot of what’s called “technical debt” in our development process. The Wild West was never meant to be this big, and taking the game to the next level has really strained us technically and mentally.

An answer to “why don’t you just do small updates weekly”

Answer: The way we built TWW prevents us from working simultaneously on small and big updates. Our team is so small that we can’t split our attention like that, so if we wanted to release small updates, that would come at the cost of the large features.

This isn’t a promise of a release date, honestly I don’t even know exactly what that will be. Once it seems like we’re out of the jungle and into the bug-testing phase, I will provide you all with a timeline.

Without further ado, here’s almost everything we’ve been working on explained:

FACTIONS: COMPLETE

Our work on factions is more or less complete, we’ve finished the backend and the interface for inviting players to your faction, granting ranks in your faction and several settings for gameplay such as a team-kill toggle.

WOODCUTTING: COMPLETE

Woodcutting is done! It will play a critical role in building. Woodcutting isn’t going to be as grindy and dry as you’re imagining it, there will be plenty of excitement and a hidden feature to discover.

BANKS: COMPLETE

Banks are done, you will be able to store items to free up your inventory. This will play heavily into building, as there will be a ton of new items you'll need to build a house.

BUILDING: DELAYED

Building has been one of our greatest endeavours and also the most painful. There are so many complex technical issues that have been keeping us from reaching the finish line. A specific example: it is very difficult to allow you to build a large house, save it and bring it to a new server without breaking the game. We’re not sure when these will be resolved, but building is our primary focus right now.

I’m really underselling how big of a feature update building is, to shotgun a few of the things I haven’t mentioned that are coming with building: electricity, lightning, burning projectiles, explosive projectiles, oil, burning your house down because you’re an idiot, some early farming, storage chests, photography, gold-panning, building resources, basic trading, basic crafting, faction houses.

FISHING: DELAYED

Fishing is well… Fishing, we’ve been having difficulty coming up with the interface for the fishing mini game itself, but we’re hoping to have it done within a week’s worth of work time. We may or may not delay Fishing until the update after next, due to some potential changes with how caught fish will be used.

THE FINAL MAP EXPANSION: UNDERWAY

The final map expansion is currently in progress, being worked on by our wonderful RedTrain, some contractors and myself. There’s probably about two weeks of work left here. The desert region is way larger than any other map expansion we’ve made, so expect a lot of land to explore. There’s also going to be a big boat that moves, yeah...

WAGONS: UPCOMING

We’re still slowly working on wagons in the background, we haven’t forgotten about one of our most asked-for features. Wagons are difficult because they require tons of math and design changes across the entire map (roads need to support wagons). We’re not sure when this will be done, it’s a long term goal.

PROGRESSION: UPCOMING

This is the largest task remaining after Building & Factions. Progression has always been our last milestone before considering TWW as a “full game”. We’ve got everything planned out, but for technical reasons this one will be a difficult update to make.

GUN CUSTOMIZATION: UPCOMING

We want to do so much more with our gun system, but this is a huge task and not something we can do in a week’s time. On our list, but probably after wagons.

HORSES: UPCOMING

Horse revamp has been on our list for a while, we want horses to be as important as cars are in Jailbreak, but it’s still in planning phases, and we’re waiting until other parts of the game are finished.

MONETIZATION

We promised we wouldn’t make the game P2W and we’re holding ourselves to that. This next update will add a few new ways for players to support us without ruining the game for others who can’t afford it. Keeping the game profitable but also non-P2W is difficult and requires us to put some extra effort into the design of our economy.

NEW ITEMS

New items such as guns, roleplay gear and new loot come with every update, they’re never our priority, but we try to include them because more stuff is better. Handheld instruments are on our list. PAID ACCESS SPECIAL REWARD Yes don’t worry we haven’t forgotten, players who purchased the game in paid access will receive their special items this update. Thanks for your continued support everyone, from now on we will try to be more transparent with what we’re doing on a weekly and monthly basis.

The entrance to the Docks has a sign displaying the text "PUERTO DORADO." Upon walking in from the entryway is the main pier, which features lanterns and wooden railings. The platform features an assortment of barrels and crates, some under an awning. The right boardwalk has roped railings and features what appears to be a cargo platform. The left boardwalk is long, with roped rails and a few crates. It eventually leads to nowhere. Close to the docks are building plots .

Trivia [ ]

Despite being a minor build, the Docks are marked as a sublocation on the game map . This was most likely to show a sure point to board the Steamboat, as opposed to swimming and jumping on when it still ran. A sneak peak of a house was shown built in the plots at the Docks. There is a treasure location at the Docks. When the Steamboat was close to docking and was docked, controls in the wheelhouse were deactivated to prevent players from stopping permanently. When a fresh new server is made, the Steamboat starts began its endless journey docked here as usual.

The Doctor is a role gamepass available for The Wild West.

To become a Doctor, players can approach the hiring post at a Doctor's Office . One building is located at the front of Bronze City , right next to the Sheriff's Office and Jail and The General Store , the other one is at Little Reservation near the exit towards Silvertown

Doctors can sell Bandages to other players for money Players can pay $100 per bandage, with $80 going directly to the Doctor. These act as a consumable healing item that can be kept in the inventory.

The Doctor also has the ability to help friends and foes using their own set of Bandage tools and Antibiotics , a useful tool which can drastically increase the rate of stamina regeneration for 60 seconds. The Doctor has a 15 second cooldown after using the Bandage tool, and a 60 second cooldown after using the Antibiotics tool. Doctors cannot use the Bandage or Antibiotics tool on themselves. These tools are automatically equipped in the role slots (7 and 8) when the role is taken on, and can be used with the primary interact prompt on other players. The Bandage tool cooldown does not impact the ability to sell bandages, being a separate mechanic.

Additionally, NPCs will sometimes come into a doctor's office when a doctor is nearby. They will complain of various issues, and the player can provide treatment. There are three options. One is to tell the patient to rest which will reward $50 and 100 XP for the doctor role. The NPC will then walk to the back of the office which has beds and sleep for a few minutes. For $100 and 200 XP, the player can give the patient antibiotics, which has a 50/50 chance of the NPC taking it and thanking the player or refuse to pay the price and leave. Lastly, for $300 and 500 XP, the player can prescribe "miracle tonic." The NPC has a 50/50 chance of taking it or refusing to pay. If the patient takes it, they will drink it and say they feel better. However, there is a probability that the NPC will then die and the player will be charged with "criminal negligence." You will NOT get XP or money if the patient dies.

Trivia [ ]

Antibiotics are currently the only way to boost or replenish stamina. Interestingly, Root Beer mentions boosting stamina in its item description, but actually boosts regeneration. Antibiotics can counter the negative health and stamina effects caused by poison arrows . The Doctor Role has a 30 second cooldown to reclaim after resigning or dying. The Joalland Dart Pistol can be obtained through reaching a doctor skill level of 20, and was previously unobtainable before Version 4.0. In the Bronze City Doctor's Office, a bell can be found displaying the text "Ask for Service", sending a message to all nearby Doctors. If none are nearby, a message will appear to the user of the bell saying: "There are no Doctors nearby!" This bell can also be rung by NPCs to request service. On 09/05/2025 the gamepass price increased from 150 Robux to 399 Robux.

History [ ]

A one-story building with a similar layout to the current appearance, it was made of unpainted wood and had a pointed facade, as well as a canopy over the front entrance. It had one window on the left, with nine panes of glass instead of four. On the right was a single door. It would later be moved one unit down, and rotated ninety degrees to face the other streetfront. It would be roughly doubled in width, though no window would be added on the new side this time.

In the August Update, the Doctor would be added, and it would take on the current appearance. It has barely been changed since, with only occasional event decorations added and removed. In this update, it was remodeled, though kept roughly the same design and dimensions. A second floor and rear staircase were added, and new windows were put in both to the right and left of the doors. The doors were doubled. The building was painted white and dark grey, instead of unfinished wood.

Real Life Counterpart [ ]

During the mid to late 1800s in the American Wild West, doctor offices/houses were small clinics or infirmaries that served as a medical hub for those living in the area, and provided medical services such as treating injuries and illnesses, as well as performing surgeries. Similarly to the game, they were mostly run by a single doctor or a small team.

Location

Built right next to the Mill and Furnace , the jail is a small building. Upon entering from the main entrance, a desk and cabinet are visible on the left, and two jail cells can be seen on the right. An archway at the back of the room gives access to the inside of Puerto's walls, which lead back to the outside.

The cells each contain a few crates, a bucket, and a blanket atop the crates, presumably intended as a crude form of bedding. Adjacent to the desk, several chairs are positioned, with scattered papers adorning its surface. Upon the shelves behind the desk rest various objects, including several reams of paper, a Lemat Revolver and a ring holding three keys: one gray, one silver, and one gold.

In front of the desk is a set of stairs that provide access to the roof, which players can use as an additional entrance and exit.

History [ ]

The Dorado Jail was added in Version 3.4 , but the building itself was added alongside the rest of Puerto Dorado and The Great Desert in the 3.1 Update. The building may receive a Sheriff post in a future update, likely arriving alongside the Upper District .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Outlaws are only sent to this jail if they are arrested within the Great Desert or the Highlands . Many players have usually not been to this jail for that reason. The ability for Outlaws to turn themselves in was not added with the main release of Version 3.4, instead happening a few weeks later as a quality of life fix. The gray key seen on the key ring is the same key as Hudson's Key and the Black Market Key . A Mule Shotgun can also be seen leaning up against the table.

Characteristics [ ]

Doctor Lazarus is a relatively tall elderly man. His hair and ureleased mustache are distinctively white. He wears a Laboratory Coat and a pair of Red Glasses, which can be obtained by following his task. He has likely been working to resurrect his wife with the power of electricity for some time, considering how crazy he has become.

Behavior [ ]

Doctor Lazarus can be seen in his laboratory going over the scientific work he has done to make his machine work. After he receives the mandatory supply of two thunderstruck items to start his machine, the doctor will retrieve his son from the chapel and bring him down to the machine. Pastor Everett then starts arguing with him, trying to convince him not to do it. The doctor goes through with it anyway and gets stuck in the air by three electrical coils.

Journal [ ]

The text inside Dr. Lazarus' journal reads as follows:

Robert Lazarus' journal

I find myself unable to bear the grief any longer. I look into my son’s eyes and all I see is her, my beloved, stolen away by godless outlaws. My heart feels as though it has turned to stone, an ancient relic of the vibrant muscle it once was.

Today, young Everett, our precious son, preached a moving sermon about the acceptance of death, the acknowledgement of the eternal silence that follows. It’s poignant, but I cannot, will not accept. The silence scares me more than any mortal fear ever could. My dear Elizabeth deserves more than silence.

How I yearn for her laughter, the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke of the flowers she loved to tend. Death is not the end. It cannot be. There has to be a way to bring her back to this world. I must delve into the science behind the cessation of life.

I’ve been going over several theories, most absurd. Nryca’s Law of Life Conservation, capital nonsense… but Baxendal’s Prism of Life Resurgence? There may be potential therein. His obsession with electricity carries weight I neglected before - could lightning hold the key to resurrection?

A moment of inspiration has struck, quite literally. Could the power of thunder be harnessed? Could one use storm-kissed material to fuel a machine with such sublime energy?

Bronze City loves a good storm. If there is any place in the world we can harness so much raw electrical force, it’s there. We must move. Everett is not keen, but this is bigger than us now. He will understand, eventually.

My life has become my research, my research my life. Every storm, every legend, they are symbols of hope, almost holy in their potential power. Construction on the machine begins tomorrow. An end to the silence, my love. Soon.

Tonight, Everett warned me of seeking to usurp the natural order. The once fiery pastor, now trembling at the sight of my work, raising a storm. But he will understand when he hears her laughter again, feels her love. He will.

The machine is complete. It lives, and with it, the hope of returning Elizabeth to life blooms anew. Will it work? The next storm shall tell. Our thunderous reunion is imminent, my love.

Dr. Lazarus' Laboratory

Type

Location

Inhabitants

Dr. Lazarus' Laboratory is a sublocation found under the Church and Dead Man's Rest .

Dr. Lazarus ' Lab is an underground laboratory where Robert Lazarus studies the effects of lightning on life, and has built a machine to resurrect his dead wife. The lab can be accessed via a staircase in Dead Man's Rest. The staircase leads downwards, and lets out in a hallway full of shelves with books and scrolls, tables with candles, human bones, and glasses with mysterious compounds inside. An open coffin, ribcage, two crates, and other props are scattered around. Past the hall is a small staircase tunnel that leads into the main floor.

The main floor features three large tesla coils, which are strung together by wires. These wires connect to a large power generator, which is called the "Electro-Resurgence Engine". For power, the machine requires two thunderstruck items which players turn in to Lazarus. The machine also powers a large electrical tower above the lab. When active, the tower blasts electricity into the sky causing the Lightning Storm . Around the floor are more shelfs, and a hand drawn prototype of the Electro-Resurgence Engine.

The Entrance having been blocked in Santa's Request.

Once the event ended, both Dr. Lazarus and Pastor Everett disappeared from the Churchyard. The entrance to the lab was boarded up.

1.1.1 Extractor 1.1.2 Lightning Essence 1.1.3 Animal Blood

Quest [ ]

The walls of the lab held many opportunities for adventure throughout Undead Legends .

Vials [ ]

The front hallway has a table where players can pick up empty vials 5 at a time for free, stacking to 10 vials per backpack slot. These have multiple purposes that send players across the map, and require special tools to fill them.

Extractor [ ]

To fill the vials, players will need to use the Extractor item. To obtain it, players can claim it free from Pastor Everett. After players give the doctor two thunderstruck items, he will fetch his son and turn on the machine. Lazarus then gets stuck in an electrical field, where players are quested by his son to get free him. Everett then allows players to take the Extractor using a [G] prompt .

Lightning Essence [ ]

To free Lazarus from the electrical field, players need to return 50 vials of Lightning Essence to Pastor Everett. Lightning Essence can be obtained by using the extractor on the body of an Undead . Each Undead can fill one vial.

Animal Blood [ ]

In order to spawn the Skinwalker , players need to collect one vial of Deer , Bison , and Bear blood. Each animal carcass can fill one vial of blood.

Lore [ ]

The story of Lazarus' obsession with mad science began with tragedy. Lazarus' wife (the mother of Pastor Everett) was kidnapped and presumably killed by outlaws. Outraged, believing that this form of death was not fair for such a dear family member, he began grieving her to an extent where he descended into madness over trying to bring her back. His nine-page journal details key events in his transformation to a mad scientist. Over time, he planned and perfected what he calls the "Electro-Resurgence Engine", which was designed to harness the power of lightning to bring her from the dead. Instead, upon using the machine Undead Zombies rose from their graves and populated The Wild West .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

On the main floor, one of the many human skulls can be seen lit the color of lightning essence, possibly showing the mad scientist held electrical experiments on smaller scales. Many of the bottles have a liquid that resembles the color and light properties of lightning essence. The tower is likely based on the Wardenclyffe Tower built by Nikola Tesla. Additionally, it also bears heavy resemblance to a similar tower at Doverhill in Red Dead Redemption 2 . The entrance was reopened with the return of Undead Legends as the Halloween event for 2024 . The entrance is blocked with wooden planks ever since the end of the 2024 Halloween event on November 13th 2024.

The Dragoon Pistol is a revolving shotgun.

It shoots 3 pellets, each dealing 17 damage. Headshots from these pellets deal 24 damage, resulting in a maximum potential damage output of 72. Notably, among the game's shotguns, the Dragoon boasts the fastest fire rate. While it is quite similar to the 1855 Revolving Shotgun , it surpasses it in firing speed, albeit at the expense of reduced overall damage, fewer pellets, and accuracy.

Pros: [ ]

High damage Shoots 3 pellets Good for finishing off targets Fast fire rate

Cons: [ ]

Long reload Very low accuracy Cannot be fanned Low headshot multiplier Weak Bullet Penetration

Mechanics [ ]

The Dragoon Pistol acts as a fast-firing double-action revolver. It cannot be fanned and has the lowest accuracy of any gun in the game. At close ranges, it deals heavy damage (capable of killing in two shots to the body) and fires even faster than automatic firearms like the Harmonica Rifle and Prototype Pistol . Unlike other shotguns, it cannot kill with a single shot to the head due to the small amount of pellets.

Trivia [ ]

The Dragoon Pistols are based off of the Wesson and Leavitt Dragoon Revolver , an early 6 shot percussion cap single action revolver. In real life, the Dragoon had a 6 round cylinder, was single action, and the frame that supported the side hammer only went down one side. It also broke open upwards instead of downwards and could only be loaded through the front of the cylinder. Production was stopped due to a Colt patent on self-indexing revolvers . The Dragoons were the first weapon to have two separate versions, allowing players to use two of the same gun in combat. In Halloween 2021 , the addition of the Cursed Volcanic Pistol allows this to be done with the Volcanic pistols as well. Auction Sidearms and the Volcanic Pistol (normal) can have two of the exact same gun equipped; however, unlike the separate versions, they all share ammo, making it a waste of space. The Dragoon Pistol has no proper firing animation, the hammer does not move when fired, and the cylinder rotates 72 degrees in one step instead of the slower rotation that most other revolvers do. Version 3.4.16 removed the shells that could be seen loaded into the Dragoon for unknown reasons. The Dragoon Pistol has the highest bullet penetration of any shotgun in the game, albeit still very low. The Dragoon Pistol has the lowest accuracy of all shotguns. Currently, both the Draggon Pistol and its golden variant display as "Dragoon Pistol" in Quests and the inventory.

It is no longer awarded by the Dread Pirate Pack.

Trivia [ ]

The Golden Dragoon was originally called "DragoonGolden" in the inventory, with Golden Dragoon as the description. Currently it is called "Dragoon Pistol", with "golden" mentioned in the description. Wesson and Leavitt did not produce fully golden dragoon revolvers in real life, however some models were produced with polished gunmetal, giving details such as the frame hinge, trigger guard, and engravings a golden shine. As the finish wears off, the gunmetal may be seen underneath on the frame of more worn examples, giving a similar appearance. Real life examples operated similar to the Colt Patersons , though with an external hammer. Production was shut down for patent infringement, leaving guns like the Lindsay Doubleshot Pistol to exist as an alternative repeating firearm. The Dragoons were the first weapons to have two separate versions, allowing players to use two of the same gun in combat. In Halloween 2021 , the addition of the Cursed Volcanic Pistol allows this to be done with the Volcanic pistols as well.

Description

The special aspect about this gamepass is the exclusive Caplock pistol, which gives players a caplock pistol without having to grind Exploration and Sidearms progression trees, and a saber, which is a reskin of the Machete from the Exploration tree.

Despite being somewhat lacking in content, many players enjoy this gamepass because of the weapon it gives, and the roleplay opportunities that it creates.

For fans of the Dragoon Pistol, the Golden Dragoon was a slightly different version, having a unique draw animation that was twice as fast as the normal pistol, and was unfortunately unable to be held while carrying another player or stolen bag of cash .

Revamp [ ]

Trivia [ ]

This gamepass may have been a hint at "The Wild Seas", an in-development pirate game by Starboard Studios . The Golden Dragoon uses the generic Rifle draw animation, allowing it to be drawn faster than the Dragoon Pistol. With the Golden Dragoon and Dragoon Pistol equipped, this is one of the only ways to have two of the same gun equipped while having them not share ammo. The addition of the Cursed Volcanic Pistol were the second set of sidearms able to do this, and were added during an event. The beard may have been inspired by media depictions of Vikings, or of English pirate Blackbeard, known for appearing to have a braided beard, full of flames. Due to the braided beard being a textured mesh, its color cannot be changed in the customization tab. On 09/05/2025 the gamepass price was increased from 250 Robux to 299 Robux.

Drum

Price

Restricted Notes

Portable

Location

The Drum is an instrument that can be purchased at the Auction House in Howling Peak . The starting bid is $2,000.

It is immediately given to the player upon winning the auction, or sent to the Mailbox if the player's inventory is full. Due to the limited amount of noises that can be made on a single drum, there are a variety of different sounds in different tones available, allowing for use of the full keyboard.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Drum is similar to another item, the Bongo Drums , which is a camp item that cannot be destroyed or moved when placed. The Drum is merely a portable version with a much higher note range. Unlike most other available instruments, the Drum is a percussion instrument, and as such, doesn't do nearly as well with sustained notes. The Drum does not visibly display anywhere on the player's avatar when equipped, likely because of its large size and odd shape. The Drum has a sell price of $700 but can only be sold in the Black Market .


--- Dueling ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

A duel is a legal fight between two players.

A duel must be agreed upon by both parties, requiring a participant to challenge their opponent and the opponent to accept the challenge. If Citizens or Lawmen duel, they will not gain a bounty upon attacking or killing their opponent, and can do so without going Hostile . Going Hostile will give the duelists "Danger" status despite being in a duel.

How it Works [ ]

An image of the Duel GUI, featuring the Player's name, timer, and duel icon.

Going near a player that is applicable to duel with and holding [F] (without holding any weapons ). This will send a request to duel, displaying the message "Asked [Username] to duel" or "Asked [ Custom Name ] [(Username)] to duel" . If they click "NO", a message will be sent to the player that sent the duel prompt, displaying: "[Username] declined" . If they click "YES", a 120-second long timer will pop up at the top of your screen that displays: "Dueling [Username] (000s)" . The objective is to kill the other player before the said player does it first. If no player is killed and the timer runs out, the duel will end. Once the duel ends, a message will be sent in the chat box , displaying "[(Username)] killed [(Username)] in a Duel!" , "[Custom Name] [(Username)] killed [(Username)] in a Duel!" , or "[Custom Name] [(Username)] killed [Custom Name] [(Username)] in a Duel!"

The duel will unconventionally end if either player is Ragdolled, including if they are Lassoed , Paralyzed , hit with the Baton and sent to the ground, fall from a height that enables fall damage, Horse Rammed , or uses the Ragdoll Button gamepass .

Tips [ ]

The duel will start immediately after accepting the request. Trying to negotiate with an opponent about the start time of the duel is recommended. This ensures that both players draw at the same time, which makes the duel more fair. Most players will start at 115. If a player dies for any reason, the surviving player wins the duel; regardless of whether or not the surviving player killed them. This can be problematic if there are Outlaws around, as they may kill either duel participants. The player whom requests the duel is able to draw first. This is due to the player on the receiving end having to accept the duel prompt prior to drawing their weapons, which lock the mouse cursor into reticules . Spacious and areas with barely any players are recommended for a fair duel. This ensures that bystanders are not used as shields and/or places to hide from or used as shelter are unavailable. Items that heal the player can be used in a duel, however it is usually considered unfair to the opponent.

Trivia [ ]

If both users die at the same time, no winner is announced in the chat box. Moving the Backpack UI to the bottom right of the screen can allow players to accept duels without unequipping their weapon, however they will still have to close the Backpack UI. The key to start a duel was originally E, however this was changed to F in July 2021 to a pop-up due to accidental duels. When the system was first added back in 2019, the duel timer began at 30 seconds. If a Citizen and Outlaw duel, the outlaw will not lose their bounty status if they lost. Dueling is the only way players in Factions can bypass friendly fire disabled when trying to fight other members.

Dynamite is often favored by Outlaws and Factions for its invaluable use in robberies , combat, and capturing Forts . It, or another form of explosive, is required for any robbery that involves bars of gold, typically for blasting open reinforced safes. Dynamite can also be used to instantly unlock the jail cells in forts , though it may harm players locked inside in the process.

Dynamite can be purchased at any gun shop in the special section for $75 or can be found in loot from sheriff or outlaw NPCs.

A video sneak peek of the "New explosion effect", in use from 3.2 to 3.5.

Mechanics [ ]

Throwing Mechanics [ ]

Dynamite comes with a fuse that lasts for five seconds. As soon as [LMB] is pressed, the fuse is activated. Pressing [LMB] readies the Dynamite, positioning the player's hand for throwing. An indication of the throwing trajectory is shown through a green arc with a small highlighted area around it. Clicking [LMB] again will release the Dynamite along the indicated arc. However, if the fuse expires, the Dynamite will explode, regardless of its location. If the player unequips the Dynamite or switches to another item, the lit Dynamite will drop at the player's current position. Upon landing, the Dynamite may bounce or slide for a short distance depending on the surface.

If [LMB] is held instead of clicked, the Dynamite will be thrown upon the mouse being released.

PvP mode, Friendly, and Hostile [ ]

Equipping Dynamite from the Hotbar will place the player into PvP mode. If the player is Hostile , readying the Dynamite will give them the Danger status. Throwing the Dynamite does not reset the Danger counter, however when the Dynamite explodes, the Danger status countdown will reset itself. If the Dynamite is thrown while Friendly, and then the player switches to Hostile before it explodes, it will not trigger the Danger status. It will, however, still give a bounty for harming other players or horses.

Explosion Damage [ ]

Explosions deal damage based on proximity. The closer a player or animal is to an explosion, the more damage they will take. If Damage Amount is displayed, 100 to 120 will be shown as a Headshot, with red text, while 50 to 99 are displayed with normal white text. Explosions can deal damage through walls, doors, floors, and even terrain if close enough. Players caught in an explosion will be forcefully ragdolled and thrown away from the explosion, possibly leading to additional fall damage. Players killed by explosions will be tossed in a similar manner. Animals do not detect explosive damage as belonging to a player, and will not be angered by it. Due to the short range of Dynamite, animals may be angered by proximity while attempting to kill them with Dynamite.

Cooldown [ ]

Once Dynamite is thrown, a three second cooldown activates before any other Dynamite can be equipped.

Trivia [ ]

The Dynamite has a six second fuse, with a three second cooldown between throwing and equipping dynamite. Dynamite should not be confused with TNT Charges , which are operated with the Detonator and cannot be thrown. Dynamite can be used to make players do flips and spins if blown up. Players can chase people while holding lit dynamite, then throw it at the last second to take them out. They can also hold on to the dynamite until it explodes, however this will guarantee their death. Dynamite is one of the cheapest items in the game, and one of the few consumable weapons.


--- DynamiteHistory ---

Dynamite is one of the oldest lasting items in the game, and has remained consistent in its usage, though balancing changes have made it explode quicker, deal more damage, have more functionality, and even be able to damage animals and NPCs . Explosion effects have even changed throughout these updates, making the animations more unique and fitting for the game.

Red Dead Redemption Series [ ]

Bronze City [ ]

Bronze City was often compared to Armadillo in its early days. Nowadays some might compare it to Valentine, due to some similarities, especially the General Store .

Worthington‘s General Store [ ]

Worthington‘s General Store is located in Bronze City and seems inspired by Worth‘s General Store in Valentine .

Silvertown [ ]

The small settlement of SIlvertown seems heavily based on the town of Strawberry .

Arthur Morgan's Grave [ ]

This grave, a reference to Red Dead Redemption 2 , is found in Alpine Meadows, at the peak of a hill, facing Raider Canyons . It has several bouquets left at it, as if Arthur's player had achieved a high honor rating. A copy of his grave, it simply reads "A. Morgan".

John and Abigail Marston's Graves [ ]

These two graves are found in Dead Man's Rest , have the latest dates in the game, and are reproductions of John and Abigail's Graves from Red Dead Redemption .

J. Marston, 1873-1911: "'Blessed are the Peacemakers'"

A. Marston, 1877-1914: "Always in our hearts"

Blackwater [ ]

Before the 3.1 Update, The Great Desert and Highlands were fairly empty. In the area near what is now the steamboat river were the words "Blackwater", a reference to Red Dead Redemption .

Fort Mercest [ ]

A very basic clone of Fort Mercer from Red Dead Redemption before 3.1, this Fort has since been replaced with Puerto Dorado .

Callahan's Manor [ ]

Callahan's Manor was inspired by Braithwaite Manor from Red Dead Redemption 2 , which also was a reference to the Oak Alley Plantation mansion in Louisiana. The name Callahan was taken from Arthur Morgan's alias of "Arthur Callahan" when he was undercover.

Back to the Future [ ]

Emmett Brown's Grave [ ]

Located at Dead Man's Rest, this grave is a reference to the Back to the Future franchise, specifically the third part, in which the protagonists visit the Old West, and Emmett Brown needs to find a way to prevent his grave from being made in the past. This is a copy of said grave.

Old DeLorean [ ]

Hidden away in a closed off mineshaft on the right side of the Desert Mine , a dusty model of the DeLorean from Back To The Future can be seen. Along with the car, there is also a toolbox and a note on a table that reads "Repair Instructions: As you can see, the lightning bolt shorted out the time circuit control microchip. The attached schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit with 1955 components. - E.L.B" .  The entire area was previously only accessible via glitching/rolling through now removed boards, but some of the these were later removed to allow easy access.

Event [ ]

The main focus of the event was the Temple of the Egg . Players could attempt to complete an obstacle course challenge to obtain the Doc Holidegg reward and Best in the West badge.

Various Moai Statues and Eggs could be found decorating towns all throughout the map, most notably within Bronze City and around Callahan's Manor .

The Eggphone UI would appear on the middle left side of the screen. Developers and some YouTubers could also be seen using the Eggveloper Cannon 9002 during the event, which fired physical eggs, allowing players to collect the Eggveloper Egg of "X,Y,Z".

The Wild West Mobile Temple was released two days into the event for mobile and Xbox players.

Update [ ]

The Wild West went free to play with this event update. Originally intended to be free for a limited time, returning to paid access with building's release in the summer, neither building or a return to paid access would happen.

Aside from the game becoming free, several major changes were made.

Whispering Summit and Bear Paw Valley were added, while Pinewood Hills was expanded. Server sizes were increased from 20 players to 30. All code was redone for optimization and development reasons. Several guns were rebalanced, notably the YellowBoy Rifle and Mauser .

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The name of the egg is a reference to Doc Holiday, a famous American gunfighter and gambler in the Old West. The name "The Temple of the Egg" may have been inspired by the 2019 Egg Hunt area of the Roblox game Labyrinth , which was called "temple of egg". The Location name displayed as "Egg Temple" in-game. The temple has since been abandoned, but can still be accessed through different mineshafts and holes. Only two sites hold Moai statues in game today: a few small ones located in the Temple of the Egg and three large ones near Little Rock Reservation and Mill Run Lagoon .

El Saguaro is housed in a large sandstone building connected snugly against the west wall of Puerto Dorado, directly to the north of El Establo . The saloon has four entrances: two from the roofs, one from an alley that wraps around the back of the stable, and the main entrance.

The Saloon boasts a vibrant and welcoming interior, with polished wooden floors, dark round tables, and matching chairs arranged across the room. Several NPCs can be seen seated and chatting, contributing to the building’s lively ambiance. At the center stands a prominent circular bar, complete with stools, a shelf of assorted bottles, and a mounted skull and horns above. The Piano sits by the staircase near the back entrance plays hearty music when idle for customers while they enjoy their meals and drinks, served to them by the Barkeep . From the lively patrons to the carefully placed decor, the saloon captures the charm and character of a bustling western gathering spot.

Tucked into a corner is a stairwell, which gives access to the balcony and the roofs of the town. The balcony includes tables and a mini-bar, featuring a design similar to the first floor, with worn wooden planks and a sturdy railing.

Restricted Notes

The Heavy Guitar , commonly known as the Electric Guitar or Dev Guitar is a developer-only instrument which has been spotted in-use by various developers, community staff, and content creators.

The Guitar uses the electrical effect from Mjölnir and Thunderstruck Logs , though only while being played, and is a deep black and red. It uses sound effects reminiscent of an actual electric guitar. The electricity that appears is a visual pun: an "electric" guitar, rather than one that literally uses electricity to produce a sound.

Gallery

Trivia

The guitar cannot be seen plugged into an amplifier, as most electric guitars are. Instead, it has a sound hole like acoustic guitars. As shown in a video showcasing Xecular using the Heavy Guitar, it had the power to heal people at incredible speeds, making a kill near-impossible unless it was done in a single shot. The ability has since been removed. The Heavy Guitar was the successor to the Flute, as the Flute was previously the Developer-only instrument, which players can now buy from the Auction House. It is now one of several Developer-only instruments currently in the game.

Appearance [ ]

The Elves wore lime-colored clothing, with smaller details of red. Tiny jingle bells could be found attached to to the hat and shirt of the Elf, but they did not make any sound. The Elves were abnormally small; about half the size of a player. This would make it tricky to kill one, because their hitboxes were as small as their character model. They had random cheery faces and tiny Laser Cannons .

Behavior [ ]

Elves attacked any Outlaw that dared to come and disturb the peace of Santa's Gift Shop. If an Outlaw was in their line of sight, they would start firing at them with their Laser Cannons. If the Outlaw was hiding behind cover, the Elf would stop shooting and run up to the Outlaw to get them back in their line of sight. When not in combat, they patrolled the three stories leading up to Santa's Gift Shop.

Hunting Tips [ ]

Due to the Elves' small size, large amount of health, and tendency to appear in groups, fighting them was very dangerous. It was best to use heavy hitting weapons like the Lancaster Pistol while taking cover as much as possible.

The Elves had a 10% chance of dropping " Elvish Clothing ," represented by their hat. When a player picked this item up, they would unlock the full Elf clothing set (Elf Shirt, Elf Pants, and Elf Hat).

The Elf Pants and Elf Shirt have two variants, but are stored as one cosmetic each. The Elf Outfit displayed is randomly selected when the server starts up, and can only be changed by switching to a different server. No matter what, the shirt and pants will be rendered with the other outfit's piece. This also affected the Elves themselves. If the server displays the shirt with striped arms and a collar covered in bells, the pants will display as the bottom of the tunic with boots. If the server displays the shirt as the tunic, the pants will be displayed with the striped socks and shoes.

However, to hunt these small beings, you would have had to be an Outlaw prior to coming face to face with these creatures in order to deal any damage to them, let alone kill them.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Elves may be linked to the Otherworldly Beings who own the UFOs . The small size of the Laser Cannons seemed to have impacted their damage, dealing almost seven times less. It is impossible to wear a fully matching Elf Outfit. The Elf Hat appears to belong to the striped suit, and is the only Elf cosmetic to not have two versions. A 2020 elf in a train ticket booth.

While guns that were designed to fire volleys do exist, the Elliot's volley feature is likely based off of a chainfire, a type of misfire where the discharge of one chamber ignites and discharges other chambers at the same time. The Remington New Repeating Pistol, also advertised as Elliot's Pocket Revolver, came in several configurations. The five barrel seen in-game was chambered for .22 rimfire cartridges, while a four barrel model of the same design was also produced, firing .32 rimfire cartridges. The firing pin revolves to fire the stationary barrels, similar to the Lancaster Pistol . In real life, a six barrel model also existed, using a zig-zag system to rotate the barrels, with a stationary firing pin. The Elliot 5-Shot is the only derringer currently in-game.

Trivia [ ]

Color 2️⃣ holds the vast majority of the reactions to the original sneak peek, with the later reload animation being shown on color 2️⃣. Similar to the Volcanic Pistol , the New Repeaters were sold in No. 1 and No. 2 models. No. 1 had five barrels and was chambered for .22, while No. 2 had four barrels and was chambered for .32. The precursor to the New Repeaters, Elliot's Pocket Revolver, had six rotating barrels with a stationary hammer. Elliot's New Repeaters were known as pocket, vest, or derringer pistols. They had an overall length of five inches. Unlike most other unreleased weapons, the new sidearm has only been shown in Roblox studio over a grey stud background. It is unknown if the "new sidearm" used to introduce the pistol is a reference to the "New Repeater" name Remington sold it under, or if it just refers to the gun being an upcoming sidearm. While the ring trigger operation has not been shown, the New Repeating Pistols functioned in a similar manner to the Lancaster Pistol , with an internal revolving pin acting on the stationary bores.

Overriding Animations [ ]

Some emotes override other animations and can be used to hide many actions. This can be useful to know in all kinds of situations because animations are often used to portray an important action, which hiding could be advantageous. Many animations can play at the same time, so pay attention to what parts of the player model are affected when performing certain actions. Also note that while animations can be cancelled with emotes, new animations may cancel the emote, especially firing, or finishing reloading a gun.

Default [ ]

Hands Up and Hands Up 2 override almost all arm related animations, from reloading, to aiming, to lockpicking. This can be used to disguise an aimed gun, Tomahawk, Knife, or to make the character's hitbox skinnier, allowing for smaller gaps to be slipped through. Whistle , Wave , and Threaten only affect the left arm and hand, and are short animations (Whistle having a cooldown), and can't realistically be used to cancel any animations. Salute also only affects the left arm and hand, however is a toggle on/off, allowing players to aim or perform other actions while saluting. Stinky is a short animation that affects both arms, and can be used to briefly cancel animations. Clap is a toggled two handed animation that produces loud clapping noises, and can be used to cancel many animations, or at least disguise them. A Tomahawk hides well between the player's quickly moving hands. Dance is a full-body animation, and overrides almost every other animation, and is toggled. It can be used to override the Running animation, Climbing, Sitting, Horseback riding, instrument playing, lockpicking, and almost any other animation.

Emote Pack [ ]

Dance 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , Kalinka, and Yakuza all act the same as Dance , from the default pack. Dab acts like Stinky , but is static. Bow , similar to Dance , is a full body animation, however it's a short one that doesn't loop, and animations will resume when finished

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Emotes can be used as long as you aren't ragdolled, even if you're tied up with a lasso, are sleeping in a bed or are on trial. The emotes icon used to have a small diamond below the circle. This would later be removed. A new emotes icon has been teased. Sprinting with the hug emote produces a janky run, which is similar to a ghostly or zombified movement. If a Mayor decides to clap, dance, or perform one of the first four Emote Pack dances, any of the Mayor's Guards , if present, will also perform it.

3.1 Locations 3.2 Weapons

Behavior [ ]

At first glance, they appeared the same as the Snowmen who have appeared in years past, positioned with a smiling face and often toting a firearm. With eyes and mouths of coal, a carrot nose, a cozy scarf, and a festive holster, these Snowmen appeared to be jolly and kind. They continue to keep up the act until they are hurt or approached, at which point they would not hesitate to pull out their gun and open fire.

Unlike other NPCs, Evil Snowmen did not patrol their area, instead preferring to stay in one place. When made aggressive, they usually remained frozen to the ground but would occasionally chase a target by shuffling towards them quickly. If the target leaves or dies, they would reload their guns before freezing back up and going to rest.

Christmas 2023 & 2024 [ ]

The Snowmen made a comeback during the 2023 Christmas update. Used by Santa to replace the Elves , they realized that they were working under "severely adverse" conditions and wanted to Unionize. Santa attempted to hire the Pinkertons to scare the Snowmen back to work, however they responded by stealing the presents and arming themselves against him. With all the Evles fired, and the Pinkertons failing to threaten the Snowmen into obedience, Santa promises to make it worth the Players' while if they "melt" some of them for him.

Unlike the Evil Snowmen from 2021, 2023's Snowmen do not have teams, and also do not have the damage multiplier from the Frozen Volcanic Rifle .

They have a 10% chance to drop Frosty Gun pieces, which can be combined to the Rednose Rifle by Santa.

Locations [ ]

Evil Snowmen spawn randomly across the map, typically in areas with snow. Known spawns include:

Bronze City Pinewood Hills Callahan's Manor Tribal Forest The Great Plains Bear Paw Valley

Snowman spawns in 2023.

Weapons [ ]

All Evil Snowmen carry the revamped YellowBoy Rifle . In version 3.9 (4.0), this did not render on their backs when not held. In the updated 3.9.1 version, it can be seen either carried in their arms, or rendered on their backs at all times.

Unique Behavior [ ]

Snowmen gained a few abilities as compared to the Undead Legends NPCs. During Santa's Request, they can be seen hopping over short obstacles like the fences around the empty plots in Bronze City. They may also fire in short bursts while sprinting if pursuing a target, or if a new target enters their range while they are still pursuing an older target. Visually, this appears similar to the shiftshooting technique performed by Players. Snowmen were also far more aggressive than during Frozen Days, chasing players far further and at greater speeds.

Snowmen can be Horse Rammed . Notably, they do not take damage from melee weapons. Thrown weapons, such as the Tomahawk , will deal damage, but do not stick into the Snowmen. They cannot be Lassoed . Arrows will stick into Snowmen, unlike throwing axes.

The Snowmen gained early access to the unreleased Spencer Repeating Carbine and Marlin Pump Action Shotgun, and used them throughout most of the 2021 event. Unlike Elves , some Evil Snowmen were not on teams. In 2023, no Evil Snowmen were on teams. Evil Snowmen displayed odd behaviors when using guns. Snowmen using Lochke Revolvers did not fire double-shot bursts, and Snowmen with Hammerless Revolvers tended to fire only four rounds before reloading. Snowmen with the Mare's Leg shot slower than the minimum fire rate, and could reload while firing. Snowmen with Winchesters always cycled the lever before firing, unlike players and Skeletons, who cycle after firing. Compared to the Skeletons of Sinner's Moon , Snowmen had a far larger selection of weapons in 2021.

1.1 Pros: 1.2 Cons:

Description [ ]

This ammunition takes longer to charge than normal arrows and travels at lower distances. They appear to have a singular stick of Dynamite strapped to the arrow, which detonates after about 6.5 seconds. The arrow deals normal damage, despite having only one stick. They work as a longer range version of Dynamite. They can be used for everything their three-stick counterpart can. Explosive Arrows can be bought at the Black Market for the hefty price of $150 per arrow or dropped as loot from sheriff or outlaw NPCs.

Trivia [ ]

The explosive arrow follows a fixed fuse that starts when it is drawn, and can explode in the user's hands if held for too long. Unequipping the bow stops this. Despite only having one small stick of Dynamite, instead of the throwable's three, it still deals the same damage to Fort Gates. Players may fire the arrow while on friendly, and then swap to hostile after the arrow lodges in another player to ensure a kill, with no chance of the target fighting back. The Frozen Horn Bow , Lightning Recurve Bow , and the Skin Walker Bow are the only Bows that cannot use Explosive Arrows. Before the 4.0 Update, the only way to obtain these arrows was to purchase them at the Black Market or trade with other players.

Obtaining the Extractor [ ]

Pastor Everett attempted to give players the Extractor whenever they ask how they could help when he was in the lab with the electro-resurgence engine active. Interacting with Pastor Everett with the [G] prompt would also result in him giving the player the Extractor if they had somehow missed it. Empty Vials could be found on the table next to the stairs, and picked up in stacks of five. Empty Vials can be stacked up to 10 per slot.

Extracting Blood [ ]

The main purpose of the Extractor is to fill Empty Vials with blood, taken from the corpses of the Undead , as well as most Animals during the 2023 Halloween Event . Holding [E] near Animal or Undead corpses extracts blood. Players must have at least one Empty Vial and at least one empty Backpack slot when extracting from Animals. When extracting from the Undead, players must have either an empty slot or a stack of Lightning Essence smaller than ten.

Lifesteal and Melee [ ]

The Extractor features a unique lifesteal or vampire mechanic. When used on a player, NPC, Monster, or Animal, the Extractor will deal 15 damage, and instantly heal 15 health to the player using it. It is not only limited to living beings; anything that invokes a hit-marker on stab (such as corpses) will heal the player.

This ability has a six-second cooldown, during which the Extractor will only deal five damage per hit, and will not heal the player.

This ability may also always be used to heal from Horses , as they never die, simply collapsing when "killed". Players can heal off of their own horse, or any horses that they can deal damage to.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Extractor is the first and currently only tool, weapon, or item to have a lifesteal mechanic. Players regenerate 2hp/second when not in direct combat. Players also regenerate 4hp/second while under the effects of food or drink, and 10hp/second while bandaged. Healing effects essentially completely negate the low damage of the Extractor while on cooldown, and players regenerate fast enough to heal from damage caused by it if they are not consistently stabbed with the Extractor.

Description

The Faction Logo is a cosmetic gamepass that is very useful for starting, large, or well-organized factions .

By simply adding a photo decal ID from the ROBLOX toolbox or uploading a unique picture, players can add a custom logo to their faction via the in-game menu. Faction members will have the logo displayed next to their names on the player list and above their heads. Additionally, the logo appears above any Fort on the map screen and on Fort flags and banners, as long as the faction that owns the gamepass owns the fort.

Players often enjoy this gamepass because of the additional customization it gives to large factions.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Custom Faction Logo is the only gamepass not featured in the in-game shop . If a faction with a logo captures a fort and leaves, the custom icon stays on the flags and banners. If a faction with no icon captures it, the previous icon is still displayed.


--- Factions ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 4.0 .

As of the Wild West's Free & Factions expansion, players were given the ability to create and modify their own Factions.

To create a faction, select the Factions menu via [U]. The Factions menu displays existing factions, which players can use to join or request to join factions. From then, the option to create a faction is highlighted in green.

Creating a faction is completely free. Optional expansions to increase the faction capacity are available for purchase along with creating a Faction Logo .

Joining a Faction [ ]

To join a faction, press the [U] key or click the factions icon placed at the bottom of the player options on your left-hand side of the screen. This is the Factions Menu , and it will display a list of public factions which you can join upon selecting the icon. Click the faction you wish to join, and a request to join is sent to the faction owner who will accept or deny your request.

The starting menu of a faction when a player is not in any.

An alternative way of joining the faction is by having a faction leader or officer send you an invite. Upon the sending the invite, you will receive an in-game notification giving you the option to accept or deny their invitation. 
If nobody in the server is in a faction, the selection menu will display "NO FACTIONS".

Faction Settings [ ]

WARNING: Using the settings to set your faction name, faction tag or faction logo to one that is inappropriate may result in moderation action from The Wild West.

There is a large variety of optional changes in the faction settings menu. One of the aspects that can be changed is the faction name. It is recommended to change this first, because the default name players get is [Your username]'s Faction. To change a faction name, type into the "Change Name" box and then select "Change".

Players can change their faction tag as well. A faction tag is usually an abbreviation for a faction's name. For example, a faction named "Cool Faction", would change their faction tag to "C.F." Of course, the faction tag can be changed to anything, but it is smart to use the acronym of the faction name. Changing the tag of a faction is similar to changing the name; by clicking on the "change tag" box and then selecting "change". The periods in between are automatically put in place.

Faction members can help increase the maximum amount of a faction.

When players first create a faction, there will be a limit to a maximum of 5 faction members. Robux can be used to increase the threshold of players in a faction, adding 5 more members each purchase. Faction slots can be increased indefinitely. Faction members can contribute to increasing the maximum amount.

Players can leave a faction at will. This can be done by selecting the "Leave" box. Leaving a faction puts the player back at the faction starting menu. For owners of a faction, the "Leave" box will instead be replaced by a "Disband" box. When disbanding a faction, there is a warning to the loss of previous purchases used to increase the player threshold. To the contrary, disbanding a faction will still retain the purchases and other parts of the faction when the owner creates a new faction.

Faction settings menu.

There are two smaller settings. One is "Kick Guests on Leave". This relates to one of the ranks that can be given to faction members, which is the Guest rank. This rank is the first one players get when they join the faction. Therefore, if the "Kick Guests on Leave" setting is on, guests will be kicked when they leave the server they are in. The other setting is "Friendly Fire". If this setting is on, players in a respective faction will not be able to damage each other, even if they are an Outlaw . The only way to damage them is through Duels . This setting could be very useful in raids.

The last setting is the Change Faction logo. Changing the logo requires the Faction Logo gamepass . Owners of the gamepass can change the logo by pasting a decal ID into the field. This ID is visible by viewing the decal on the browser they use.

The decal ID is circled in red.

Faction Ranks [ ]

There are a few ranks that can be obtained in Factions. Different ranks have different responsibilities.

Ranking Somebody Up.

In order to rank a player up, the leader of a faction must go to the Faction Menu (U), hover over a person in their faction, click on them, and click either "Rank Up" or "Rank Down" on the options displayed.

Here is a list of the ranks that you can get in Factions, and what they can do:

Leader - This rank belongs to the owner of the group. They can rank people up and down, invite people, kick people and edit the faction settings (there can only be one leader per faction). Officer - This rank can accept and send join requests, rank people up and down to member, kick members and guests. Architect - This rank has no authority. They are unable to be kicked by Officers and they may have something to do with the future Building Update . Member - This rank has no permissions and unable to be kicked on leave, unlike the ''Guests''. Guest - This rank has no permissions and is the rank given when players first join a faction; they will be kicked on leave (if "Kick guests on leave" setting is on).

Faction Perks [ ]

The factions icon is visible over the player's head.

When in a faction, groups will find each other much easier. This is because in a faction, the faction's icon will be visible over players heads to other faction members (unless they are sneaking) and vice versa, as well as being able to see faction members' locations on the world map (as long as the World Markers option is checked). Players in a faction can also join other members of their faction in the server their allies are in even if they are not friends, and/or don't have their joins on.

Another perk is the friendly fire. This will allow for easier confrontations with other players in a group without accidently harming one another.

The icon shown on the World Map to represent a Faction Member.

Although players can capture Forts without being in a faction, it is easier and more viable to capture and hold Forts with other faction members, and prolong the various perks of owning a Fort, such as a respawn point , a sawmill , bank crates , beds, gatling guns , cheap guns ( Volcanic rifle and pistol ), prison, a special store that sells wares such as bandages , flare guns , logs , smoke bombs and build tools . there is also an outlaw drop-off zone and many more. The logo of the faction that owns a fort will also appear on the flags and banners on the Fort.

Notoriety & Territories [ ]

Notoriety is a system that determines a faction's rank on the Faction Leaderboard . To gain Notoriety, faction members must fire up a Signal Cannon to trigger a raid and then hold the area for 30 seconds, guarding it until the Notoriety Counter (shows on the map) ends; each captured territory equates to 1 Notoriety point.

Every faction's Notoriety count is positioned right under the member count. The faction color option changes the background-color of the shaded territory area.

Factions that reach top 2 on the leaderboard grant their owner the [Western Legend] title and their members the [Notorious] title.

Notoriety Milestones [ ]

The current claimable Territories are: Pinewood Rail Camp , Buried Library , Church , Quarry , Sinner's Canyon , Bandit Hideout , Copper Gulch , Abandoned Fort , Native Camp , Lumberyard , Fort Henry , and Fort Spencer .

(Servers with less than 10 players get discluded from the Notoriety System and hence don't have a timer, this is to ensure fairness)

Trivia [ ]

The original name for factions were posses, but this never made it into the final cut. A new factions icon has been teased. There also were territories in Swamp and Howling Peak , although those have been removed.


--- Fanning ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 3.9.3 .

Fanning , sometimes called " Fan-The-Hammer ", is a mechanic based on the real-life technique of fanning the hammer, in which the shooter would hold down the trigger, and rapidly slap back the hammer on the gun, causing the gun to shoot at a much faster rate, at the cost of accuracy. This works with single-action guns, which do not reset the hammer automatically, and some triple-action guns, which can fire in both single and double action.

Fanning greatly increases the fire rate of the gun in-game, and can be done with most revolvers, as well as one pistol and a rifle .

To Fan-the-Hammer, hold [F] while firing, or shoot while not aiming .

Fanning the Hammer decreases accuracy, and the gun is impacted by recoil far sooner. The most accurate fanned guns are the Model3 Revolver and Volcanic Repeaters, having very little recoil, and only small accuracy decreases while fanned.

Trivia [ ]

The Lochke Revolver's unique firing pattern applies even while fanning, resulting in extremely fast bursts punctuated by slightly longer delays between the bursts. Overall, the Lochke fires about as fast as other fannable revolvers. The Volcanic Repeating Rifle's firing speed is more than tripled while fanning the hammer. Peacekeeper , Model3 , and Lemat all share similar fire rates. The Volcanic Pistol and Volcanic Rifle cannot actually be fanned in real life, however a similar effect can be produced by holding down the trigger and rapidly cycling the lever. Fanning a gun's hammer in real life is dangerous, and puts stress on the gun, which can lead to damage. Pressing [F] with the Spitfire Revolving Sniper will not fan the carbine, instead toggling between Scope and Iron Sights. It is the only gun to have this feature, and the only gun to have an alternate action performed with [F].

Costing 250 R$ during Christmas Events until New Years in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, and 2025, the Firework Launcher , also known as the Firework Gun , is a variant of the Flare Gun , with a faster reload, infinite flares, louder sound, and much more light. Fireworks leave an arching trail of grey smoke puffs, and have a steeper arc than the flares .

Upon hitting an object, or running out of fuse time, the firework will explode with a loud boom that can be heard across the map. The explosion bursts into a multicolored scattering of particles and creates a green light source under the explosion. This light source is much smaller than the flare, and is about as big as a Lantern's area.

The Firework Launcher gamepass was first put on sale during the North Pole Christmas 2020 event . It returned once more during the Frozen Days Christmas 2021 event. However, it was not available for purchase in 2022, as no Christmas event took place that year. The Firework Launcher returned in the 2023 Christmas event and 2024 Christmas event.

Trivia [ ]

The Firework Gun appears to load Flare Gun Ammo, but it does not consume any and has a different explosion effect. Rolling with the Firework Launcher or the Flare Gun is one of the only ways to roll without entering combat. The Firework Gun appears to be a flare pistol, possibly of French origin. The Firework's sound was made quieter within days of being released because it could be heard all over the map and drowned out every other sound underground, no matter the distance. This item leaves a green glow, instead of the yellow seen from fire, the red from flares or the Reindeer , or the blue from Skeleton Horses . The Gamepass can be found here , and was on sale for a limited time. Although it was sold in 2023 and 2024, the firework's gamepass description on the ROBLOX website still says "say goodbye to 2021". The Firework Gun does not appear on the hips of players; rather, it seemingly appears out of thin air when held.

Fish are a type of Animal that can be found swimming through most bodies of water in the game.

They exhibit a more detailed behavior pattern than other animals, often leaping out of the water at specific times and weather conditions. Currently, fish primarily serve as environmental decorations and cannot be damaged or interacted with, save for attacks from the fearsome Gerald .

Fishing [ ]

Fishing is an unreleased and upcoming addition to The Wild West. It is planned to release alongside Version 5.0 , the "Skills & Levelling" Update, according to the official 2021 Roadmap. How Fishing will play out is currently unknown.

However, it has been mentioned that Fish will be "catchable in any way imaginable, though fishing rods will give the most value" (paraphrased), though it is unknown if this will be the case.

Trivia [ ]

Fish are by far the most realistic animals currently in the game. Curiously, although there are Bears , rivers and waterfalls, salmon are not an included species of fish and do not currently exist, despite the sign at the Plantation 's General Store mentioning them.

Flare Guns and Flare Gun Ammo can only be purchased in Forts, and do not drop upon death, stacking up to ten.

Mechanics [ ]

Flares leave a light grey trail of smoke behind them before igniting. When fired, they will fly in the smoke trail phase for two seconds, or until they make contact with a solid object, player, or piece of terrain. Interestingly, flares go through Horses . Once being active for two seconds, or being interrupted, flares will ignite in a red flash, with a darker red distortion around them. They will stop flying through the air at this point, and slowly glide straight down until contacting terrain, flora, or buildings. This ignited phase lasts for thirty seconds, in which a large radius of red light, greater than a Campfire will be projected around and underneath it, and an audible hiss will be heard. Flares that contact terrain or buildings will "stick" where they hit.

Trivia [ ]

The Flare Gun resembles a Remington Mark III Signal Pistol, though this particular model of flare pistol is on the cusp of being anachronistic, being produced for WWI which is a few years farther than The Wild West 's likely time period. A different version of the Flare Gun was released in the 2020 Christmas Update and was called the Firework Launcher . It shoots colorful blasts instead of regular flares, and doesn't require any special ammo. The Flare Gun is one of the few ways to roll without entering PvP. The Flare Gun is break action, and the flare can be seen being inserted into the barrel. Instead of being consumed once you reload, Flare Gun Ammo is consumed once you fire. As a result, leaving the game with a flare loaded into your gun will not take away the flare upon rejoining. The Flare Gun Ammo model can be seen being loaded into the Firework Launcher, but does not require or use any Flare Gun Ammo. The Flare Gun is one of few items that physically requires Special Ammo to fire, the other item being the Blow Dart Gun . All other special ammunition is loaded into other weapons with their own respective ammo.

Mechanics [ ]

Flares leave a light grey trail of smoke behind them before igniting. When fired, they will fly in the smoke trail phase for two seconds, or until they make contact with a solid object, player, or piece of terrain. Interestingly, flares go through Horses . Once being active for two seconds, or being interrupted, flares will ignite in a red flash, with a darker red distortion around them. They will stop flying through the air at this point, and slowly glide straight down until contacting terrain, flora, or buildings. This ignited phase lasts for thirty seconds, in which a large radius of red light, greater than a Campfire will be projected around and underneath it, and an audible hiss will be heard. Flares that contact terrain or buildings will "stick" where they hit.

Trivia [ ]

The Flare Gun resembles a Remington Mark III Signal Pistol, though this particular model of flare pistol is on the cusp of being anachronistic, being produced for WWI which is a few years farther than The Wild West 's likely time period. A different version of the Flare Gun was released in the 2020 Christmas Update and was called the Firework Launcher . It shoots colorful blasts instead of regular flares, and doesn't require any special ammo. The Flare Gun is one of the few ways to roll without entering PvP. The Flare Gun is break action, and the flare can be seen being inserted into the barrel. Instead of being consumed once you reload, Flare Gun Ammo is consumed once you fire. As a result, leaving the game with a flare loaded into your gun will not take away the flare upon rejoining. The Flare Gun Ammo model can be seen being loaded into the Firework Launcher, but does not require or use any Flare Gun Ammo. The Flare Gun is one of few items that physically requires Special Ammo to fire, the other item being the Blow Dart Gun . All other special ammunition is loaded into other weapons with their own respective ammo.

A transverse flute, it is held horizontally when played. Prior to the 3.4 Auction House Update, the Flute was a Developer item, and has since been replaced by the Heavy Guitar . Although the Flute is a quiet instrument, it possesses almost the full range of notes and can play very sustained pitches, making it ideal for many MIDI files.

Trivia [ ]

The first Flute sold for $2,000,000. This became a community joke, with the official Discord server even having an emoji and a sticker proclaiming "Two million For a FLUTE". The Flute is likely an Irish flute, which shares the characteristics of a wooden body with metal joints, as well as the lack of keys over the tone holes, unlike the mostly metal and keyed Concert Flutes which began gaining popularity in the late 19th century. This instrument holsters horizontally on the right hip, similar to the Harmonica . Prior to the 3.4 Update, this item was a developer-exclusive item and was only given to moderators, community managers and special players, like the music YouTuber, Xecular. The Heavy Guitar now holds the spot for the developer instrument . The Flute has a sell price of $1400 but can only be sold in the Black Market .

The cave has five entrances: one is located on the hill where the camp sits, another is by the river near Hunt and Trade , a third is behind a pile of rocks north of Red's Lumberyard , and a fourth is a hole under a teepee in the camp. There is also a hidden entrance nestled in a rocky crevice near the Tribal Camp, accessible from a narrow ravine near the Tribal Camp. Check the gallery for images of these entrances.

The cave is one of the largest in the game. It has a few winding paths, but is mainly organized around a large central chamber with a subterranean waterfall and small body of water. Large, twisted roots have been added throughout the cave, appearing to grow through the rock walls and floor. Two Bears spawn in the cave: one is found near the entrance in the hill east of Tribal Village, and the other is in the Dead End .

The cave, being as large as it is, contains many ore deposits . In total, there are 10 Zinc deposits , 2 Large Zinc deposits, 9 Iron deposits , 2 Large Iron deposits , 2 Silver deposits , 8 Gold deposits and 1 Large Gold deposit . 3 Gold deposits can be found in the Dead End.

Players could previously kill the Bear in the Dead End then place a Camp Tent over its spawn. When the Bear would respawn, it would be trapped inside the tent, making for easy grinding.

Type

Location

Inhabitants

The Forest of Bones is a small portion of The Wild West's underworld, representing Hell. Crawling with the Undead, all sorts of ghastly creatures can be found here, none for the faint of heart.

Dead and decaying trees grow alongside blood red corals, and tattered fabrics similar to those found tangled in the Wendigo 's antlers blow through the branches. Massive skulls of all shapes and sizes are sunk into the valley-like realm, with sheer rocky cliffs and murky waters discouraging attempts to escape. Ribs and jagged rocks break through the already harsh landscape, many resembling all manner of creatures. Players cannot use their map or view the time while inside the Forest.

Locations Within the Forest [ ]

Ancient Descent [ ]

The Ancient Descent leads to the front gates of the Forest. This tunnel opened during the Sinner's Moon , allowing Skeletons to access the West. The cave tunnel gives a glimpse at what is to come, with harsher stone and decorations from the Forest becoming increasingly common the closer one gets to the Gates. The Gates of Hell can be found about a third of the way back up from the Forest, and could not be opened from the inside during the Sinner's Moon. The Gate could only be opened with piles of bones, and rusted shut once the event ended. During Halloween 2022 , the gate opened, and remained open.

Front Gates [ ]

Two large pillars, and the ruins of something sit at the entrance to the forest. Glowing red Greek letters are in the pillars, Delta, Sigma, and Omega. Broken Knight Statues guard part of the area, and a large glowing Symbol is carved into the floor. In The Forest of Bones Event, players teleported straight here with the sacrifice of raw meat. During Sinner's Moon and Halloween 2022, players had a long walk down the Ancient Descent before arriving at the unwelcoming gates.

Plateau [ ]

A small bowl is formed in the ground here, with water around the outer edges, and a divot in the middle. Skeleton Horses spawned here during The Forest of Bones, but in Sinner's Moon, a Skeleton and a Zombie Bear spawned here instead. During Halloween 2022, the Skeleton was removed, but the Bear remained.

Mid-way Gates [ ]

A large, mostly intact, set of raised gates divides the Plateau from the Marshes, the Plateau bottlenecking into the gates. The Marshes, likewise, have a steep hill with switchbacks leading into the gates. During both Sinner's moon and 2022, a Zombie Bear spawned in the switchbacks.

Marshes [ ]

Wet, hostile, and full of broken knight statues and decaying pillars, the Marshes are a scenic, yet dangerous, place in the Underworld. A large castle overlooks them, and the Forgotten Sanctuary can be found at the far end of the Marshes. In The Forest of Bones, a herd of Skeleton Horses could be fought here, as well as a handful of Gerald , a dark god in the form of a deep sea monstrosity. Large arches and statues could be climbed to avoid the Undead here. In Sinner's Moon, a massive army of Undead Skeletons patrolled the Marshes, making approaching the Forgotten Sanctuary difficult. Zombie Bears also roamed the outskirts, making the little dry land around the edges of the valley dangerous. During 2022, three Zombie Bears stalked the marshes, no longer sticking to dry land.

Forgotten Sanctuary [ ]

The Sanctuary is a large circular chamber, hidden inside a cliffside tunnel. It was previously used by the Mysterious Traveler and their companions, and possibly Leonard Callahan . A massive Symbol makes up the floor of the chamber, powering an exit portal. During The Forest of Bones, a couple of notes could be found around the Sanctuary, from the Mysterious Traveler. During Sinner's Moon and 2022, the Legendary Skeleton guarded the exit, the portal appearing only after its defeat.

Trivia [ ]

"Sinners Remain Forever." is etched above the Forgotten Sanctuary. In the 2020 Halloween event, Outlaws could not use the exit portal, which was the only way out. During 2021, Outlaws could use the exit portal, though it was possible to leave through the Gates of Hell if opened from the outside. In 2022, this was changed, the gates remaining open at all times. The Skeleton Horses here were hunted and stolen by players during The Forest of Bones, which is why they are absent in Sinner's Moon. The theft of their horses angered the Skeletons, and thus led to the invasion of the Undead. The Skeletons were presumably defeated during Sinner's Moon, leading to their absence in 2022. The Legendary Skeleton remained behind, however. The Forest of Bones is still visible in-game, if you look west from Whispering Summit . It is recommended to bring Binoculars or a scoped rifle and to use Cinematic Mode if you wish to view it this way. Despite being located there, while inside the Forest your map icon appears to be in the black area north of Fort Spencer , along with any markers if someone tracks your Outlaw poster.

Forest of Bones (2020) [ ]

During Halloween 2020, players could fight their way past the Wild Skeleton Horses to make it to the Sanctuary. Inside, two notes from the Mysterious Traveler could be found, one describing how close they were to harnessing the powers of the undead, and the other, seemingly in Latin, describing a ritual.

Sinner's Moon (2021) [ ]

The horses stolen, the sanctuary was guarded by Zombie Bears and a few Skeletons . The notes had been removed, and inside, the Legendary Skeleton lay in wait, brandishing a Volcanic Pistol , with its head shrouded in flames. The boss dropped the Ceremonial Dagger , possibly hinting at Leonard Callahan 's involvement.

Happy Halloween (2022) [ ]

The Sanctuary was once again protected by the Legendary Skeleton. No other Skeletons, Horse or otherwise, could be found. The Symbol was removed from the floor, and an invisible ceiling was added over the Sanctuary, so players can no longer climb over the Sanctuary and rain shots down on the boss with no risk of retaliation.

Features [ ]

Just like its Bear Paw Valley counterpart, Fort Spencer , Fort Henry has two bank chests which can be accessed regardless of the player's wanted status. A special Fort Supplier Shop is located here, selling items like Bandages , the Flare Gun , Logs, and the Volcanic Pistol . Loot and Stolen Items may be sold at this shop, and Money Bags may be dropped off at the flag. Fort Henry features several tents with cots, which can be slept in to regain health . Tables, an Outhouse , and two wagons may be found inside, mainly for decoration or roleplay.

Fort Henry features a Fort Jail, where players can be detained. Any member belonging to the faction that owns the fort is able to lock and unlock the cell door. The cell has a Harmonica for any unlucky prisoners to play. Players inside the cell cannot be robbed . The fort also features a Sawmill .

Henry is protected by powerful Gatling Guns . While only three Gatling Guns can be found at the Fort, two of them face the front gates, making them deadly when used together. A third Gatling Gun faces towards the Plains between the Fort and the Windmill Camp , and can be used to deter players who spawn there. In addition, a network of trenches surrounds the fort, which can provide cover for both attackers and defenders. However, a well-placed TNT Charge could bring an end to even the fastest of raiders.

The location is more secure than Fort Spencer , being located in an isolated corner of The Great Plains with flat expanses and trenches that allow for enemies to be easily spotted. The trenches below may guard enemies, and the Bison make the plains dangerous to attack from. Unfortunately, Fort Henry is very close to both the Windmill Camp and Bronze City , making it a quick target for players who just spawned in.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

A sign post outside of Bronze City points towards this location. Hunters grinding Bison on the flat part of the Plains in front of the fort are at risk of being gunned down by bored and trigger-happy Gatling Gun operators from the fort's ramparts. Players must be careful when hunting here. Angry hunters often snipe occupants with the Sharps and may try to take over the fort, resulting in war. Players should try not to attack hunters when they hunt. It is wise for hunters to reach agreements with fort owners before they use their land for resources. Fort Henry is likely linked to Zachariah Henry . Chopping down all the trees around Fort Henry and selling the logs will earn players $360. Previously, players were able to get into the fort for free by climbing up the back, holding a rifle, and jumping + rolling to land inside the fort. However, this is now impossible.

Fort Spencer is a Fort found in Bear Paw Valley . The Fort located is on a small hill, across from the Fort Spencer Station . It is commonly used in Faction gameplay.

Features [ ]

Just like its Great Plains counterpart, Fort Henry , Fort Spencer features two Bronze Bank Co. Chests , allowing faction members who have captured the fort the ability to access their banks. An exclusive Fort Supplier Shop is located here, which sells a variety of rare items, including the Flare Gun , Bandages , Logs , Smoke Bombs and Volcanic Rifle . Loot may be sold at the Fort Supplier, as well as Stolen Goods . Money Bags can be collected by bringing them to the Flag. Fort Spencer features tents with cots, used for regaining health . A few tables, lanterns, an Outhouse , and a wagon can be found inside, primarily for roleplay.

Fort Spencer has a Fort Jail, used for detaining invaders or enemies of the Fort's owners. This jail also has a Harmonica , which non-faction members can play.  Players cannot be robbed while in this jail. In addition, a Sawmill can be found inside, used to craft planks for use in repairing the gates.

Fort Spencer's proximity to The Quarry and the numerous Bear and Bison spawns nearby make it a good place to hunt or mine from, and a good place to make money in general.

Four Gatling Guns covering almost every direction the fort faces. Two face the main gate, and the other two face the surrounding valley and Train tracks. Despite this, it is generally considered to be less secure than Fort Henry. The fort can be attacked from any side, with the neighboring mountains providing clear views of the inside for easy sniping. Trains pass right under the fort walls, allowing fast access, and the woods and mountains can provide cover for approaching enemies.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Previously, a glitch allowed players to jump over the entire hill and fort while on horseback. Fort Spencer received Día de los Muertos decorations during The Forest of Bones event . These included white pumpkins and skulls on different colored paper. Fort Spencer is a great fort to use for hunting Bears because it is very close to the Bear Triangle , meaning you can easily and quickly sell your loot. The name "Fort Spencer" might be a reference to the 1999 frontier thriller film Ravenous , where the main setting is at a place called Fort Spencer.

It is elevated on a wooden platform and has wooden crates stacked around it, one of which has a disassembled Gatling Gun inside. It also has a windmill and a water tower on either side of it and a ramp leading up to the top of the platform. The station itself is a decrepit combine train car , refurbished and placed in the middle of the platform. It features some seats for players to enjoy while hunting or waiting for trains. Nearby, materials for track laying can be seen.

Fort Spencer Station is also useful for hunting due to the fact that there is a constant flow of spawning Bison . Be careful, however. Since the station is near Fort Spencer, it is in range of one of the fort Gatling Guns. It can also provide cover while hunting Bison or attacking Fort Spencer.

Trivia [ ]

Fort Spencer Station was added after the North Pole event was reverted. This train station was slowly built over time. It was located down in Bear Paw Valley as a wooden platform, near the train wreck at Fort Spencer. Finally, it was made into a train station. The train car used for the station might have been repurposed from the nearby train wreck. Fort Spencer Station was originally to be a large red building, like those seen in the Copper Gulch Mine . Before Version 4.0, a railroad handcar can be seen on the unassembled track. It is labelled "Sheffield Velocipede Car Co.", a company which was established in 1877 in real life. In 1881, they began producing railroad hand-cars, similar to the one seen. Despite being a train station, trains never stop here.

Ashburn Prison Camp is a heavily guarded facility featuring two watchtowers fully staffed with Ashburn Guards , along with defensive platforms lining the top of the outer walls. A green supervisor’s tent is located near the entrance, and a stable-like structure stands to the right. Although players cannot escape or break out of the prison, Ashburn Guards will open fire on any outlaws who come too close to the camp. Guards spawn within the barracks and frequently patrol the area, adding to the camp's sense of activity and security. While most of the barracks buildings are inaccessible, one room can be entered by players. All guards wear the same uniform, though their weapons may vary. They have 150 health and are extremely dangerous.

Mechanics [ ]

Outlaws that are arrested and or plead guilty by the Mayor with Menace status are sent to Ashburn Prison, serving a sentence of 300 seconds, or 5 minutes.

While serving a sentence here: players are given protection, lose access to their tools and weapons, are chained to one of the many poles surrounding the interior of the prison, and are given a Tier 1 Pickaxe to mine the Coal deposits inside the prison. Each Coal deposit mined earns the prisoner $2 , as well as a 10 second sentence reduction. Non-jailed players cannot mine the Coal deposits found in the yard, and will be met with the message "You cannot mine this ore!".

If the player leaves the game, the player's sentence will be reset to 300 seconds upon rejoining.

Escape Strategies [ ]

Players can jump over the wall by hopping onto the pole where the chains are attached. However, these chains will remain attached to the player's legs, causing them to ragdoll if they go too far beyond the walls.

If you play on ROBLOX Player, you can [Alt+Tab] out of the game while holding [LMB] to automatically hold down left click until it is pressed again, allowing you to mine coal indefinitely until going back to ROBLOX while in another window.

Players can get themselves killed from a variety of ways. They can repeatedly climb onto the prison walls and jump to slowly kill themselves while in prison. Animals will also be provoked to attack the player, if they somehow enter the prison—however they have trouble entering through the large doors.

A Hitman can accept hits on incarcerated players; however, the target cannot be harmed until their sentence ends.

Dying while jailed resets the 300 second counter, and allows the Mayor (if the role is filled) to hold another trial, allowing for a chance of escape.

Trivia [ ]

The minimum time a player can spend as a prisoner is 114 seconds. Ashburn Prison Camp was formerly known as the "Prison Camp" and later "Fort Tyler"; named after tyridge77 's forename. Ashburn Train Station was formulated as a passageway to enter Santa's Workshop during the North Pole event . Trains do not stop at the Ashburn Prison Train Station. Previously, camp items could be used to glitch into the barracks. Theoretically, if a player is constantly killed by Animals or fall damage before being released, they will stay in Ashburn indefinitely.

Current Forts [ ]

Players can capture and control two forts: Fort Henry in the south of the The Great Plains , and Fort Spencer in the north of Bear Paw Valley .

The Ruined Fort appears similar to Henry and Spencer, but does not have Fort functionalities, instead only being a Territory . Ashburn Prison Camp was previously known as Fort Tyler, but is built with a different style, and functions as a labor camp for menaces and high bounty criminals.

Features [ ]

Forts come with several interesting features, found in very few other places.

Fort Specialties Shop [ ]

The Fort Specialties Shop is a shop that sells items. Found in the fort's main building, players can use this shop to purchase weapons and materials useful in the maintenance of a fort. Specialty shops can only be used if the player is in control of the fort. Attempting to open the shop in an uncaptured fort results in the "You must capture the fort!" error.

Fort Specialties Shop Wares [ ]

Smoke Bomb

Gatling Gun Ammo

Spawn Point [ ]

Fort Henry and Fort Spencer both have their own spawn locations, only accessible to the fort's owners. After respawning, these locations have a 90-second cooldown before they can be spawned in again. Fort Henry's spawn location is a great Bronze City outpost for your faction while Fort Spencer is great for making money as its next to plenty of bison and The Quarry .

Bank Crates [ ]

In both Forts, there are two Bank Crates. Players are able to use these crates to store their items in their personal bank, as long as they or their faction has captured the fort. This is the only way for players with a bounty to store or take items from the bank.

Sawmill [ ]

Both forts feature a Sawmill within, which allows players to saw logs into planks. These planks can be used to build Siege Ladders or repair the Fort Gate. Alternatively, the spinning blade can be used as a way of execution.

Gatling Guns [ ]

Mounted atop the fort walls are numerous powerful Gatling Guns. They are able to rapidly churn out damage to any enemies within their limited range, but they quickly burn through ammo. Fort Henry has 3 Gatling Guns and Fort Spencer has 4 Gatling Guns.

Outhouses [ ]

Both forts have an Outhouse, perfect for roleplay or allowing a player to hide when in a tough situation, although the thin walls make it easy for bullets to slice through .

Jails [ ]

The Fort Jail is housed inside one of the smaller buildings in both forts. Players can jail enemies inside of a small cell with a chair, a bed, and a playable Harmonica . Enemies are unable to reset or use any weapons or tools while inside the cell, and they cannot be robbed while inside. The Fort owners can open the cell door at will, but jailed players must either exit while the door is unlocked or pick the lock to escape.

The lock to the jail's door takes 45 seconds to successfully pick. While doing this, prisoners can dance to hide the lockpicking animation, but the captors might notice this and lasso or kill them.

Beds [ ]

Each Fort offers its occupants a total of 4 beds. 3 of these are in small tents, and one is in the Fort Jail. Injured players can use these to regain some health without spending money on Bandages.

Flag [ ]

At the center of the fort is the fort's flag. This flag has the name of the player or faction who currently controls the fort on it, and their Faction Logo , if applicable. The flag appears as the faction's color. By pressing [F] , players can toggle the text on their flag on or off. As a player is capturing a fort, the banner will slowly curl back up.

Outlaw Drop-Off Zone [ ]

Outlaws can drop off Money Bags and other stolen loot in a Fort, much like they would at Outlaw's Perch or the Windmill Camp .

Attacking [ ]

In order to enjoy most of the benefits of a Fort, players must capture and take control of them from other players or Factions . There are two basic ways to go about attacking a fort.

Blowing Up the Gates [ ]

The Fort's front gates protect the only reliable way in and out of the Fort. These gates can be blown up by Dynamite or Explosive Arrows , taking 3 explosions to be destroyed completely. Players who use their Dynamite charges in quick succession can overpower resistance and force themselves into the Fort.

Building Siege Ladders [ ]

Another (more stealthy) way of getting into a Fort is to build a Siege Ladder . By approaching the outside wall of the Fort with the Building Tool and 5 Wood Planks , players can construct a ladder to climb inside. Building a Siege Ladder is wise if a Faction is already attacking the gate and nobody inside the Fort is watching the walls from behind.

Capturing and Contesting [ ]

In order to successfully capture the Fort, a player or Faction needs to remain near the flag until the old one goes down and their own flag goes up. This can be interrupted if another faction or player is inside this zone, which makes the fort contested. A contested Fort prevents players from spawning there and stops the flag from going down or up.

Remove the contested status by killing opposing Faction members.

Defense [ ]

Maintaining control over a fort is the only way to use services such as the Fort Shop and the Bank Crates . Players can deal with attackers in three primary ways.

Repairing the Gate [ ]

Players can use the Build Tool to repair the Fort Gates. As long as the gates are damaged and not destroyed, they can be repaired at no cost. Repairing a destroyed gate requires 3 Wooden Planks, made from Logs at the Sawmill . If both gates are broken, 6 planks are needed to fix them both.

Having more than one player repairing a damaged gate at once can allow for fast fixes.

Using the Gatling Guns [ ]

The Fort's Gatling Guns are valuable tools. Despite their limited shooting angle, they can shoot over 7 shots a second, dealing 20 body damage and 40 headshot damage to anyone in their sights.

Gatling Guns can only hold 36 Gatling Gun Ammo at a time. This ammo must be purchased at the Fort Shop.

Pushing Siege Ladders [ ]

If enemies are trying to build a Siege Ladder to get into the fort, defending players can simply push it down. Fort owners can approach the ladder and hold [E] to push the ladder and any unsuspecting attackers down.

Strategies [ ]

Trying to hold (or attack) one or both Forts can sometimes be very difficult. Here are some simple strategies.

Use Animals . An aggressive Bison or Bear can surprise attackers and defenders alike, especially if kept inside the Fort. Keep in mind the 90-second respawn timer for forts. Use other spawn points when defending, and try to utilize the respawn delay as an asset. If possible, die away from the fort to further delay the 90 second penalty. Use traps. Camping Items can cause horses to trip, and items like the TNT Charge and Bear Trap can weaken attackers. Some weapons can stab or shoot through the gates . This tactic can be used against attackers and defenders. Repair gates quickly, since it's easy to get overwhelmed. Remember to keep them closed as well. Snipers, when positioned on Whispering Summit or the walls around the Great Plains , are able to kill players sitting in the fort. Have two players use one Gatling gun; one shoots, the other refills ammunition and protects the gunner. Patrol the area around the fort with other faction members to prevent ambushes. If you want to play it safe, stay inside of the centre of the Fort and do not engage with attackers, unless they are directly blowing up the gates, or building siege ladders. Fight from inside of the fort.

Trivia [ ]

The Gatling Guns have armored shields in front of them, which offer protection to the user. These block all bullets, however a small slot can be shot through, and players may fire over, under, or around the shield. The front gates of both forts are fully impenetrable by any projectile. Apart from this, all other parts of the wall can be shot through with high-powered guns and stabbed with knives. It's possible for a player to get stuck in the gate while it is closed. Due to Forts being PvP zones, your hostile status stays even after having unequipped weapons. Siege ladders cannot be placed by the owners of the fort. When a server first starts, the banners will appear white and rolled up, and the gates will be wide open and fully repaired. When a Fort is abandoned (all members of the controlling faction leave the server) the banners may curl up again, but will retain the colour that the previous faction had them set to. The faction decal and name may also remain on the flag. Fort Mercest was a placeholder building for what would become Puerto Dorado that was in place before the release of the Great Desert. It was only accessible with glitches/hacks, didn't have any functions that the other forts currently in the game have and was unfinished in the interior. Its name is a reference to the infamous Fort Mercer from the Red Dead Redemption Franchise.

--- Free_Jobs ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

The Wild West has an assortment of roles and jobs to play as!

All of these jobs can be found scattered around the towns which dot the world. Jobs and roles are a fun way to experience the Old West. Make a living off pouring root beer for the cowboys as a Barkeep or hunt down a corrupt Mayor as a private Hitman. Upon death, any role will be lost, followed by a cooldown so everyone can have a turn.

Although some jobs may allow you to earn money and may give special perks, they are primarily intended for entertainment and roleplay.

Jobs are split into two categories: Free to Play and Gamepass. Free jobs can be taken on by any player, while Gamepass jobs require you to have a certain Gamepass to become that profession.

1.1 Sheriff 1.2 Barkeep

2.1 Doctor 2.2 Hitman 2.3 Mayor

Free Jobs [ ]

Sheriff symbol.

Sheriff [ ]

Most of your time as a Sheriff will be spent hunting Outlaws for their bounties and that satisfying feeling when you're staring at them through iron bars.

The Sheriff has two special tools to aid them in their journey as a lawman : the Baton and the Handcuffs .

Abilities

Sheriffs posses a Baton which they can use to whack Outlaws to the ground. The baton deals 10 damage a hit, and lowers movement speed. The second successful hit will ragdoll the target. If someone is ragdolled to the ground, you can use the Handcuffs to almost instantly arrest an outlaw, by holding E on the prompt. bypassing the 10 second waiting period.

Notes

Hiring posts can be found in the Sheriff's Office in Bronze City and the Marshal & County Jail in Delores' Ranch . Sheriffs are technically on the Civilian team , despite being Lawmen. Outlaws that Sheriffs arrest can be sent to jails in Bronze City , Howling Peak , Delores' Ranch , and Puerto Dorado .

Barkeep symbol.

Barkeep [ ]

Barkeeps serve root beer and food to any hungry or thirsty cowboy or cowgirl. All Barkeeps get a special outfit while working here and get paid $25 for anything they sell. Buying a meal or drink from a Barkeep costs $35. Barkeeps can also throw away empty plates and bottles, each of which gives them an extra $14. The Barkeep can also serve meals or drinks to NPCs , but the player will only earn $25 instead of $35. NPCs will respond with different dialogue depending on whether they are served food or drinks.

Abilities

Barkeeps can sell food and drinks with health boosts, costing the buyer $35 and giving the Barkeep who sold it $25. They can throw away used dishes for $14 in any saloon except for The Crooked Saloon . They can serve NPCs .

Notes

Uniform is a red striped vest, white apron, and white sleeves, with black pants. There can be 4 Barkeeps at a time. Hiring posts can be found in every Saloon except for The Crooked Saloon , since Outlaws cannot become Barkeeps. NPCs will visit all Saloons and can buy meals and drinks, with the exception of the Grizzly Saloon in Howling Peak and the Steamboat.

Gamepass Jobs [ ]

These Jobs cost Robux to take on. They are a one time purchase, and can be found under the gamepass categories.

Doctor symbol.

Doctor [ ]

Doctors can use Bandages to heal any player, or boost stamina recovery with antibiotics. Players can also request to purchase Bandages for $100, and the doctors make $80 per sale. Very useful in Faction combat, or while hunting dangerous game in groups. Additionally, NPCs will sometimes come into a doctor's office when a doctor is nearby. They will complain of various issues, and the player can provide treatment.

Abilities

Doctors can bandage players, healing them at extremely high rates. Doctors can give players antibiotics, which boosts stamina recovery to an extremely high rate. Players can request to purchase bandages to use later, paying $100. The doctor keeps $80 from each sale. These are the same bandages bought from Forts . Players can request service by ringing the bell on the ground floor of the Doctor's Office ; this notifies the Doctor(s) that a client awaits service by displaying a message on their screen: Doctors can serve NPC customers to earn money and Doctor XP .

Notes

The Doctor's hiring post is found outside the Doctor's Office in Bronze City and the office in Reservation Camp . The Gamepass costs 399 Robux.

Hitman [ ]

Hitman symbol.

Hitmen are killers, paid to do the dirty job of taking out other players. This Job is the only one that can be used by Outlaws . Hitmen are one of a few ways to kill Protected players. They can be hired to kill any player at varying rates between $100 and $500. Hitmen are paid 70% of the rate upon the contract's completion.

Abilities

Once hired, Hitmen are given a box on the top right of their screen showing their target and last known location. The target is given a box on the top right warning them of being hunted and showing the Hitman's appearance. The person who hired the Hitman has the ability to spectate them and watch what happens. Hitmen do not gain bounty for attacking or killing Sheriffs, Barkeeps, Doctors, or other Outlaws, but may gain a $70 bounty if they accept a hit on a Citizen or the Mayor.

Notes

The Hitman's suit is a rumpled black suit and pants combo, with a messy grey undershirt and tie. This is the only role that players can change every part of while wearing, but any equipped shirt and pants will be displayed as the Hitman's suit. There can only be one Hitman at a time. There are 2 hiring posts. One is behind the Bronze City Saloon , and one is on the third level of the Grizzly Saloon in Howling Peak . Hitmen do not get paid if the target dies, resets, is arrested, or leaves the game before the Hitman can kill them. Outlaws can be hunted for as low as $100. However, Civilians have a $300 minimum price and the Mayor has a $400 minimum price. The Hitman has an alternate outfit unlocked upon purchase, featuring a cleaner suit with a red tie. It can not be worn while the role is held. Hitmen used to have black gloves, however this was changed, instead giving their hands the lightest skin tone. Characters with darker skin tones will appear to be wearing light colored gloves. The Gamepass costs 499 Robux.

Mayor symbol.

Mayor [ ]

The Mayor role is a valuable Gamepass that comes with exclusive privileges. As a Mayor, you have the ability to interact with various elements within Auburn Hall in Bronze City, including the power to call for assistance and oversee trials. Your position makes you a prime target for Outlaws, while also earning the admiration of Civilians as a symbol of justice. The responsibility of determining who will be incarcerated or granted freedom lies in your hands as the Mayor.

Abilities

Call for Help. Mayors can use their whistle when being hunted by a Hitman or when outside of protected areas to request protection. Players who accepted would have been given the Mayor's location, the Lawman team, and $100 if they stayed in range of the mayor until the timer ran out. The Protection call lasted 100 seconds, or until the mayor was killed or made it to a safe zone. Safe zones and death wouldn't pay the lawmen. There is a 5 minute cooldown between calls. Trials. The Mayor can choose to hold a trial when a Sheriff arrests someone with Handcuffs, when a Menace is captured, or if the arrested Outlaw has a high enough bounty. Trials do not stop Civilians from claiming the bounty, or Outlaws having to pay a fine. The Mayor can decide whether the criminal on trial is guilty or innocent, and whether they get sent to jail or not. Gavel. A roleplay tool used only in trials, Mayors can slam their desk with this. Bounty Board. Mayors can pardon the bounty of any player with a bounty under $150, as listed on the board in their office. This action has a one minute cooldown. Gramophone. Mayors can interact with the gramophone in Auburn Hall to play music. Town Funds, bodyguards, town meetings, and most wanted. Mayors can acquire town funds, which are used to hire NPC bodyguards , call citizens in Bronze City to a town meeting, and double the bounty on an Outlaw with most wanted.

Notes

The Mayor's Suit is a tailed suit, open over red plaid, with dark pants. There can only be one Mayor at a time. There is only one job posting for Mayor, outside of Auburn Hall . The Gamepass costs 1000 Robux. If the Mayor or the defendant gets killed during a trial the defendant automatically gets found guilty and accordingly sent to jail; this is a downside to arresting someone as Mayor.

Friendly is the default status for Citizens. Hostile Players who aren't Wanted can toggle to Friendly with [P] . They are only unable to toggle to it when they have a bounty.

Friendly players cannot hurt other Citizens on Friendly, nor can they hurt any Citizen's Horse . Attempting to do so will be met with the error popup message "Friendly Fire!". Friendly players may, however, hurt hostile Players and their Horses.

The only exceptions to this are Fort PvP Zones, Duels , or attacking your own Horse.

Hostile tag.

Hostile [ ]

The Hostile status is likewise enabled by pressing [P]. Being an Outlaw also makes players Hostile and will show their status as Hostile (Outlaw) . Outlaws can not swap their status.

If a Hostile Citizen shoots a gun or slices a melee, they will become a Danger and will not be able to swap to Friendly until they put away their weapon for 20 seconds. Citizens are also able to legally kill and arrest players with the Danger status.

Hostile Players can harm any unprotected Player, but will only gain a bounty for harming Friendly Citizens.

Hostile Players are also able to damage and kill other players ' Horses , instead of just their own.

Trivia [ ]

Before Version 3.2 , Outlaws could remain on friendly after committing crimes. Friendly Outlaws could not hurt other Outlaws. By hovering over the icon, players can get a piece of text saying how either status works. The players' status used to be shown next to the hotbar . Status has been teased to be located at the top of the Player's screen. Shooting a horse as a Friendly can help tell if an outlaw is near, depending on if damage is dealt.

The Basic Axe is the least powerful axe in the game, but can be obtained for free. It has a compact design with a short handle and small head. When used against players, this axe inflicts 25 damage. It takes five swings to fell even the weakest Snags, and potentially up to a hundred swings for thunderstrucks, provided it can gather the base variant.

This Axe deals 25 damage to players, same as the Basic Axe, but has a slightly longer reach, and is noticeably stronger when logging, felling trees at a much faster rate. Snags can be chopped down in three swings, and up to fifty for thunderstrucks, assuming it can harvest the base variant. With longer range and a bigger blade, it's slightly more effective than the Basic Axe for combat, but still deals low damage.

Prior to the 4.0 update, the Quality Axe (at that time called the Tier 3 Axe) dealt 45 damage and was a formidable weapon, but due to the introduction of more powerful axes and axe damage buffs that can be obtained through the logging skill tree, this axe's damage was adjusted to be the same as its Reinforced and Basic counterparts, 25.

The Frozen Axe was an event reward from Christmas 2021 , obtainable for 15 "Nice Tokens" in Santa's Gift Shop .

Setting it apart from the Quality Axe is the model, appearing far sharper and much more weathered, with the head made of chipped ice. The handle is also damaged, with a cloth grip wrapped around it. In addition, it emits ice and snow particles from the blade. It functions identically to the Quality Axe while woodcutting but has a different swing noise and leaves icy trails in its wake. It is better for combat, dealing 45 damage (previously 50 before being reduced in update 4.0). It cannot be swung while sprinting; however, after the swing has started, you can sprint while the axe is still in motion. During early versions of the event, it was obtained from Krampus' Contraband for 15 "Naughty Tokens" instead. It could also be sold for $3150, but this was removed before the event ended.

Unlike the Tiered Axes, or the Frozen or Tomahawks, the Axegonne's head has a thin blade and head, with a long pointed beard and toe, designed for naval combat, instead of splitting wood. It swings slower than the other Tier 3 Axes, but can cut everything that they can. It is notably shorter, and deals less damage in combat, however it also packs a strong punch, capable of dealing up to 120 damage with a headshot from the caplock pistol that makes up the handle. Unlike the other axes, it can also be swung while running. It equips into a sidearm slot.

Materials [ ]

Logs [ ]

Axes aren't required to obtain logs (and wooden planks), but they are the most efficient way to do so, as Fort Suppliers overcharge for their logs. Logs are needed to cut into wooden planks, which can then be used to protect or raid Forts. Logs and wooden planks will likely get more use when Building releases.

Wooden Planks [ ]

Trees can be chopped down to obtain logs, which can then be taken to Sawmills to be cut into planks. These planks can currently be used to build ladders, gates, and repair broken gates.

Cactus Juice [ ]

Cacti can be chopped down to obtain cactus juice, a consumable item that provides a short healing boost to the user.

Thunderstruck Logs [ ]

In order to acquire the rare loot found in Thunderstruck Trees, the use of Axes is necessary. However, Axes can only successfully fell Thunderstruck Trees if they are capable of cutting down the regular variant of the tree. When using a Tier 1 Axe, each swing will only inflict 1% damage to a Thunderstruck Tree, provided it can effectively chop down the tree. Similarly, a Tier 2 Axe will deal 2% damage, and a Tier 3 Axe will deal 3% damage under the same circumstances.

Thunderstruck Cactus Juice [ ]

Just like the Thunderstruck Trees, Axes are required to obtain the rare loot that drops from Thunderstruck Cacti. Axes are only capable of cutting down Thunderstruck Cacti if they are capable of doing so to the normal variant of the Cactus. A Tier 1 Axe cannot chop down any Cactus, a Tier 2 Axe will deal 2%, and a Tier 3 Axe will deal 3% per swing.

Combat [ ]

When any Axe is swung, the hitbox of the Axe remains active throughout its entire animation. This means that anything the axe touches during its swing and pull-back will be hit. Axes cannot be swung while the sprint key is held, however swinging and then sprinting can be done. Due to the head hitbox being active during the full swing, players may spin or move while in a swing to hit multiple targets, though trees, players, and wildlife may only be hurt once each by a single swing.

The Frozen Axe is the most viable for combat, featuring a longer handle, larger head, and significantly more attack damage than the other axes, allowing it to kill in two swings. Unfortunately, axes swing far slower than knives , and are a good deal heavier. Their only advantage is the longer reach. Axes also can be used to clip through walls further and more accurately than knives or guns .

To counter the axes' limited movement while fighting, a Mule , Mustang , American Standardbred , or other sufficiently short horse can be ridden on to allow strikes with the axe while still remaining mobile. Taller horses will put the axes' swing above most players and animals.

The first swing of an axe takes roughly 0.6 seconds, each swing after taking about 0.5 seconds in each direction, with short halts when fully extended in front of and behind the player.

Trivia [ ]

The Tier 3 Axe and Frozen Axe are some of the strongest melee weapons, the Frozen Axe only matched for damage by the Kukri Machete . Tiers 1 and 2 appear to be Mauls, or "Splitting Axes", while Tier 3 is a "Bearded Axe". The Frozen Axe is a far more imposing Bearded Axe, and appears to draw inspiration from pop-culture Viking battle axes. It is considered a sport by many to start a duel and "joust" by using horses and an axe. This is now done with the Skinwalker Spear , due to it's range being more like a real lance. There is a method of cutting down trees faster by using two axes where one tries to chop down a tree while alternating between two axes about twice per second so that they can get more chops in a smaller amount of time. It is best performed using a Frozen Axe and a Tier 3 Axe.

The Frozen Horn Bow is a limited-time event bow that could be bought from the Krampus' Contraband shop in Outlaw's Perch for 30 Naughty Tokens during the Christmas 2021 Frozen Days event .

It has a slower minimum charge than the Horse Bow and a maximum charge just a little faster than the Longbow . The Lightning Recurve Bow and Skin Walker Bow share its damage, but not its model, animations, or ice arrow effects.

The ice arrows fired from this bow will slow down enemies significantly, reducing their sprint speed to nearly a walking pace. This makes it easier to land successive shots, or switch to a secondary weapon to finish off the frozen foe. Due to the fairly low charge time, a well placed headshot can immobilize an enemy long enough to hit them with a quick follow up body shot, or to switch to a stronger sidearm, making kills a bit easier. Unfortunately, it cannot use Consumable Arrows such as Poison Arrows or Explosive Arrows .

Like all other Bows, when an arrow hits its target, they take 20 damage over time due to the Bleeding status effect . If a Bandage is used, this effect can be canceled.

4.1 Ice Arrows 4.2 Charging

Pros: [ ]

Inflicts a significant slowness debuff Quiet projectiles No damage falloff No horseback accuracy debuff No reload Deals high damage when arrows are fully charged

Cons: [ ]

Low damage Low Headshot Multiplier Cannot sprint while charging an arrow Long arrow "reload"/nocking Not compatible with Poison or Explosive Arrows Only obtainable through trading

Gallery [ ]

Mechanics [ ]

Ice Arrows [ ]

When the Frozen Horn Bow is shot, it fires icicles instead of normal arrows. This projectile flies at the same speed and distance of regular arrows, but upon hitting a player, it applies a slowness effect. Unlike other status effects, this effect does not appear in the top left of the screen. 
The debuff lasts for 5 seconds and slows the victim depending on how fast they are currently moving. It will cause sprinting players to move at a walking pace, walking players to move at roughly a crouching pace and crouching players to barely be able to move at all. Players are still able to jump, and stamina remains unaffected.

Charging [ ]

The Frozen Horn Bow needs to be charged for roughly 0.8 seconds before it is able to fire. To reach maximum damage, the arrow must be charged for around 2.4 seconds.

Accuracy depletes after the indicators start moving again after meeting in the middle of the reticle. As the indicators move towards the center, every shot has near perfect accuracy. Damage starts at dealing 25 for a minimum charge body shot, and deals 35 for a minimum charge headshot. Damage increases the closer the indicators get to the center, and lock at maximum after reaching the center, even after they pull apart.

Once the indicators reach the center, a body shot will deal 50 damage, while a headshot will deal 70 damage. The archer has a very short window to fire the arrow with maximum damage and accuracy, as when the indicators begin moving again, accuracy will fluctuate. Damage will remain at maximum value while drawn.

Changelog [ ]

Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format.

13/12/2021: A wooden bow with red accents is teased.

25/12/2021: The Frozen Horn Bow was added to the game. It has the same model as the teased bow, but with blue wood and ice accents.

08/01/2022: Frozen Days ended. Frozen Horn Bow is now unobtainable, though can still be Traded .

20/11/2023: Undead Legends introduces Wendigo Cultists wielding Horn Bows, the Lightning Recurve Bow, and the Skin Walker Bow.

09/05/2025: Progression is released. Added bleed effect and lowered damage to compensate.

Trivia [ ]

An image of a new bow was released by Kazuhira on the Starboard Studios Discord. The Frozen Horn Bow seems to be a Christmas variant of this unreleased "normal" Horn Bow. This bow was the only bow to not use the Horse Bow 's standard arrow model after the Auction Update bow changes. The Lightning Recurve Bow uses the ice arrow model, but recolored and with electric effects. The Sheriff's Baton has a similar slowing effect on its first hit. Some Horn Bows were given out during giveaways around Christmas of 2024.

Players can hire you to kill others, and you receive 70% of the amount that the client paid for your services after killing the player specified by the contract. The person who hired you can spectate you and watch you successfully (or unsuccessfully) take down the target. With the latest update, the Hitman role now includes a progression-based skill tree.

Ragdoll [ ]

The Ragdoll gamepass allows players to collapse into a ragdoll at will, without falling, tripping, or being attacked. Using it instantly ends duels, and will cause dangerous animals to leave the player alone. It has a longer cooldown on getting up than naturally caused ragdolls. It cannot be used while a Gun is equipped, the [R] key instead bound to the Reload action. Bows and items, however, can be ragdolled with, so be careful, as ragdolling while in combat leaves the player at a significant disadvantage.

Trivia [ ]

All gamepasses were 50% off during the Christmas 2019 Winter Sale event . Only one gamepass has been removed and returned repeatedly, being the New Years' exclusive Firework Gun . Items given to the player that have the gamepass item background, such as the Mare's Leg, Banjo, Mauser etc. cannot be properly discarded and will be returned the player's inventory when they rejoin the game.

The Gatling Gun is a mounted, hand-cranked, magazine-fed turret weapon that can hold 36 rounds.

It boasts an incredibly fast fire rate and can eliminate a player with just three shots, taking less than a third of a second. Gatling Guns are exclusively in Forts , and Windmill Camp , where they remain stationary and have a limited line of sight.

The Gatling has a large and obstructive front plate used to block shots from raiders but slightly obscures the player on the Gatling Gun's view in first person. The two biggest problems with the Gatling Guns are that they do not have a very big rotation angle, (roughly 105 ° to the left or right, 30 ° to upside and 60 ° to downside), and that they burn through ammunition quickly. To reload it, players have to get off the gun and manually reload with ammunition ($50). An imperfect solution is to have a Faction member on standby to refill the gun as you fire, and to take care of anyone who gets too close. Raiders can also quickly incapacitate the player on the Gatling Gun by firing Explosive Arrows at the gun's shield, or lobbing Dynamite over the shield. Although the weapon has its fair shares of downsides, it is a great weapon for fending players off and away from your fort.

Trivia [ ]

Fort Henry has 3 Gatling Guns, while Fort Spencer has 4 Gatling Guns; likely due to Spencer having more exposed sides than Henry. Version 3.3.1 ( North Pole revert) added the Fort Spencer Station , which has a crate containing a disassembled Gatling Gun, which might hint at the possibility of being able to purchase and assemble Gatling Guns at a later date. Players can tell whether or not a Gatling Gun is loaded based on the magazine. If it's completely grey and has only a tiny bit of yellow, the gun's empty. If there's at least a little bit of yellow, a few shots are still left. The Gatling Gun possesses the fastest reload of any gun in the game, taking less than half of a second (0.25 seconds to be exact) to fully reload 36 bullets. Non-functioning Gatling Guns were included, or intended to be included, on some early Trains . Gatling Guns were first teased without the armor plate, completely exposing the operator on the Gatling Gun.

Trivia [ ]

The bullet model appears to be similar to the bullets that can be seen loaded into revolvers like the Paterson Navy . The case appears longer than the ejected casings seen out of the Winchester Rifle . Each bullet can be seen individually in the Gatling's Magazine when loaded, which can come in handy for combat situations when ammunition count is vital information. In real life, Gatlings originally used paper cartridges. In 1881, Gatlings would finally be manufactured with metal cartridges, firing .45-70 ammunition. The Wild West 's Gatling Guns appear to fire a smaller cartridge, and cannot be loaded with shotgun shells.

They move slowly when resting, however if angered, they move through tall grass and water at extreme speeds. Due to their low height, they often take players by surprise.

Experience

The Gator is a fierce predator, moving slowly but with a powerful bite.

They come in different sizes and variants and are right at home in the tall grasses and waters of the Swamp , where they can sun themselves and swim around lazily, but one oddball lives in the flooded tunnels of the Water Cavern instead.

Contents

1 Hunting Tips and Behaviors 2 Locations 3 Drops 4 Variants 5 Gallery 6 Trivia

Hunting Tips and Behaviors [ ]

The Gator is difficult to hunt due to its high health and small head. The Gator's land speed is slower than most players, so running away to escape one should work, unless the chase enters water, where Gators are at their best. Using a high surface like a log or a hill will keep a gator from biting you. A few headshots with powerful guns like the Mule Shotgun , 1855 Revolving Shotgun or Sharps Rifle are always a solid strategy, though a high capacity automatic weapon like the Harmonica Rifle or Guycot Chain Set can also make quick work of a Gator, as long as they aren't too close - or you can simply fan the hammer at a Gator's head. Some players use the Longbow , which can kill a Gator in two fully-charged headshots, but it leaves the player vulnerable while charging. The Horse Bow doesn't have this problem but will take a third shot after two headshots to kill a Gator.

Players hunting Gators should take caution, as they often rest in the high grass and puddles of the Swamp , or within the water tunnels of the Water Cavern. Highly territorial and aggressive, they will often attack players unprovoked, and unnoticed, from further distances than Bears or Bison . Their dark coloring helps them blend in further with the already foggy and difficult to traverse Swamp, which they take full advantage of. When not keeping players out of their habitat, they move slowly, and often lay around in the grass, or float in the mucky waters.

Locations [ ]

Gators can only be found in the Swamp and the Water Cavern . In older versions of the game, they were also in Dead Man's Drop and the Temple of the Egg . Only one Gator can be found in the Water Cavern, the rest dwelling in the Swamp. Legendary Gators and Albino Gators have a chance of spawning in place of normal Gators.

Drops [ ]

(Cooking Animal Meat with a Campfire adds 50% more to the sell price, making it $60.)

(The Gator Skin and Animal Meat are a guaranteed drop on death.)

Variants [ ]

Albino Gator - Albino Gators are rarer than normal gators, and may drop exquisite pelts. They do not have a Legendary version.

Legendary Gator - Legendary Gators are bigger, faster, stronger, and drop more expensive loot than normal Gators.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

During the Santa's Workshop event, several Gators went missing from the Swamp. They were later found under the ice , trapped and unable to get out. The Gator used to drop Animal Bones during the 2020 Halloween Event . Unlike other animals, Gators move faster through water. Gators have a whole mouth full of teeth! Check out their little smiles! Gators are the only animal with additional non-seasonal non-legendary variants, and the only animal with variants of this type that may spawn in place of the standard animal. The Gator was a candidate for the Starboard Studios plush toy vote. When the Gator attacks a player, their PvP is disabled, regardless of if they held a weapon or not.


--- Gems ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Ores and Gems can be obtained by Mining . Both are arranged by rarity, selling price, and availability. See Pickaxes for more information on mining.

Contents

1 Ores 1.1 Large Ore Deposits 2 Gems 3 Trivia

1.1 Large Ore Deposits

Ores [ ]

Ores are obtained by mining. You can mine by buying a Pickaxe and using it on an Ore node. You will obtain your ore when the damage bar at the top hits 100%, at which point it will be deposited into your inventory. If your inventory is full, the ore will drop to the ground instead. Ore nodes have a chance to drop Gems in the place of their ores.

Large ore deposits take less damage per hit than small deposits, and they can be mined more times before exhaustion. Only a few exist in the world, and they can be found near their small counterparts.

Ore respawn times depend on the size of your server. If you mine in a small server (under 15 players), ores will take an extended period of  time to respawn.

Large Ore Deposits [ ]

Gems [ ]

Gems are obtained through luck and chance when mining ore nodes, or by digging up Treasure Chests. They are far more expensive than regular ores and far rarer.

Trivia [ ]

Coal deposits can also be found at Ashburn Prison Camp , but only imprisoned players can mine them. They do not deplete, nor drop Coal or Gems; instead, they award a tiny sum of $2 straight to the player. Mining one of these ores also lowers the player's sentence time by 10 seconds. Gold and Silver deposits could be found in the maze in Santa's Workshop . Diamonds and Emeralds could be obtained by opening presents during the North Pole event . Outlaws who opened presents would get Coal. The Legendary Skeleton dropped Rubies and Amethysts when defeated, if enough players were in the server.

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 3.9.3 .

General Store Worthington's General Store, an example of a General Store

General Store

General Stores are shops that can be found in every town.

These shops sell a variety of tools , camp items , and other miscellaneous wares that may be useful in the wilderness. Most locations have their own buildings, with the exception of the Outlaw camp locations. Players may "Sell Loot" [F] or access the "General Store" [E] at almost every location, although some locations may have slightly different rules.

The General Store strangely faces Raider Canyons instead of the train tracks near it. The sign advertising salmon may hint at a new Fish to be released with Version 5.0 . This may also mean that it could be a place to cash in caught fish. The General Store's marker on the map isn't actually over the store. Instead, the marker is to the southeast of Callahan's Point, where this General Store was originally. Some of the bottles on the shelves are filled with Root Beer, but they cannot be purchased or interacted with. The store was revamped and moved to Delores' Ranch in the Progression Update (4.0) .

The James Co. Supply is a General Store that is located in Silvertown , close to the main entrance.

The store is housed in a building near the flowing river and on the path to the Ruined Fort. The Statesman Hotel and Post Office are located behind the building, just to the south.

The James Co. Supply is housed in a two-story wooden building, with a smaller structure branching off of it. Like the other buildings in Silvertown , this one has flat, plain walls and red, corrugating roof tiles. Outside the store, there is a wooden platform supported by several round, wooden columns as well as a staircase leading up to the second floor entrance. Additionally, an assortment of barrels, tables, and boxes are scattered around the outside of the store, and a hitching post lies near the right side of the building. The building features 3 entrances: the main entrance in the front, a side entrance in the side structure, and an entrance on the second floor.

When entering the store, you will be greeted with a lavish, brown rug at your feet. To the left, the store clerk stands behind the counter, silently watching you. The left wall is lined with various rugs and animal pelts. A shelf filled with various dry goods bags and a drying rack filled with pelts also lie along the left wall. To the right  is a fireplace quietly emitting smoke and a display case, similar to ones from the Auction House . These come along with a collection of animal heads, pelts, and feathers; they are likely trophies from previous hunting expeditions. The small branching structure contains another shelf filled with Indian artifacts and a Black Bear rug above it, as well as several barrels and crates.

The second floor can be accessed by a stairwell which wraps along the southern wall. The upstairs floor is sparsely decorated, featuring only a couple of barrels, a drying rack, and a mounted Deer head. Outside the second floor entrance, there are some animal hides being stretched on frames.

The salesman's counter guards most of the more valuable items. Some sacks of goods lie next to a set of silver scales on a table. Against the walls lie a small wood stove, a few ladders, and a broom. The second story, while visible from the street, is inaccessible and houses nothing inside.

The second floor has been removed, looking through the top floor window curtains by aiming a sidearm in first person will show it empty and the floor higher than usual due to the expansion of the room below.

This mythical fish lives up to its fan-bestowed name.

The world of the West has not yet found a way to kill the almighty Gerald , and it is likely that nobody can, as even a direct shot will not register as a hit.

The Gerald, with its slender build and sail-like fin, bears a resemblance to the real-life longnose lancetfish , a ferocious, sharp-toothed, cannibalistic deep-sea predator. It could also be inspired by some kind of barbeled dragonfish or viperfish , as the head of the Gerald seems to be modeled after a viperfish's, featuring long fang-like teeth for catching unlucky victims. Geralds are invulnerable to all forms of damage.

Lore [ ]

The following quotes come from Tyridge77 , the co-owner of Starboard Studios, copied from Discord messages:

"Gerald is a surviving deity from ancient times; his name was once 'Geah-ra-lad' in ancient tongue. The name is a result of poor translation. Legends say the first humans used to offer the beast blood sacrifices with ancient lassos carved from goat skin."

"Geralds breed from fear, they have no need for a female."

"Legends say a foolish human once tried to burn a Gerald, and fire, intimidated by such a powerful being of nature and death, would not show its face for many years. Humanity almost faced certain death by being deprived of their most basic tool."

"You can't beat Big Jimmy yet, he feasts on the blood of Geralds, he's an immortal being"

Locations [ ]

One Gerald can be found in the Water Cavern , alone.

Several are found in the Lake Cave , in two small schools.

A very large school of around 10 Gerald can be found in the Desert Mine .

Prior to the collapsing of the Egg Temple in the 3.0 Egg Hunt revert , Gerald would have been found in the Temple of the Egg . They were also found in the Forest of Bones, where they lived in the shallow lake that separated the Sanctuary from the Forest, alongside some skeleton horses . The horses were removed in the 3.2 Halloween revert , and the Geralds were removed for unknown reasons in the 3.3.1 Christmas revert .

Trivia [ ]

Use your Lasso to capture people, kidnap them, take them to a Gerald spawn, drop them in the water and Gerald will kill them. You should probably throw them down into the hole at the Desert Mine , as even entering this steep-walled pit usually results in certain death . Gerald is the only animal that will attack players when they are ragdolled. RedTrain once said, "you can technically kill gerald, "but good luck, "since you cant use weapons underwater" "if he comes to the surface" "which, he doesnt". At the time, bullets could go through water but could not harm Gerald. Gerald may be lured to the surface with careful placement of players. Even if he jumps out of the water, he still remains invulnerable. This potentially opens the door for the use of the Kukri Machete or other underwater-compatible weapons that now exist in the game. If you try to attack Gerald using the Kukri Machete or other underwater-compatible weapons, they also could not harm Gerald. Geralds are planned to be catchable, but would be extremely hard to catch. This may be added when Fishing comes out. Gerald is a fan-bestowed name, created by a Discord community member and former staff named "ToxicLad", who campaigned to name the Train "Gerald", after an original character. When the fish were discovered, and the developers did not announce a name, Discord community member Sarasin proclaimed it to be "The Gerald fish", and ToxicLad agreed. The Gerald fish is based off of the Deep Sea Dragonfish. Gerald became the second official piece of TWW Merch. Read more about the Gerald Plush here .

The Gerald Plush [ ]

The Gerald Plush is the second piece of physical Wild West merchandise, after the now discontinued Action Collection . Produced by Makeship, the developers only receive a small 10% cut of profits, but anyone who bought it receives a snuggly form of the monster fish himself .

Gerald is about 12 inches long (30cm) and 5 inches tall (11.7cm), and has glow-in-the-dark eyes.

About the Campaign [ ]

From December 8th, 2024 - December 30th, 2024 at 9AM PST, community members could buy the Gerald Plush.

It was sold for $32.99 USD plus shipping. The requirements were: If 200 Pieces are sold till December 31st 2024, it will go into production, after that it will never be available again. If the goal is not hit, all purchases will be refunded.

The 200 Plushie-mark has been reached on Dec 30th, 2024 at about 9PM PST. All orders will be shipped around May 20th, 2025. The plushie will never be sold again officially.

The total amount of purchased plushies is 251 , at 125% funded.

Trivia [ ]

The developers are currently working on an in-game gift for those who purchased the plush. Although the purchase will not be required to unlock this reward, purchasing the plush would grant the reward automatically. Currently, a Gerald Holster has been teased. Since the production is outsourced, only a fraction of the revenue (10%) is shared with the devs. The plush will allegedly never be available again, although third-party resellers will most likely pop up when the plush is delivered in May of 2025.

1.1 Large Ore Deposits

Ores [ ]

Ores are obtained by mining. You can mine by buying a Pickaxe and using it on an Ore node. You will obtain your ore when the damage bar at the top hits 100%, at which point it will be deposited into your inventory. If your inventory is full, the ore will drop to the ground instead. Ore nodes have a chance to drop Gems in the place of their ores.

Large ore deposits take less damage per hit than small deposits, and they can be mined more times before exhaustion. Only a few exist in the world, and they can be found near their small counterparts.

Ore respawn times depend on the size of your server. If you mine in a small server (under 15 players), ores will take an extended period of  time to respawn.

Large Ore Deposits [ ]

Gems [ ]

Gems are obtained through luck and chance when mining ore nodes, or by digging up Treasure Chests. They are far more expensive than regular ores and far rarer.

Trivia [ ]

Coal deposits can also be found at Ashburn Prison Camp , but only imprisoned players can mine them. They do not deplete, nor drop Coal or Gems; instead, they award a tiny sum of $2 straight to the player. Mining one of these ores also lowers the player's sentence time by 10 seconds. Gold and Silver deposits could be found in the maze in Santa's Workshop . Diamonds and Emeralds could be obtained by opening presents during the North Pole event . Outlaws who opened presents would get Coal. The Legendary Skeleton dropped Rubies and Amethysts when defeated, if enough players were in the server.

The Golden Nugget Hotel is a two-story establishment located near the Bronze City Bank in Bronze City . While it currently serves no gameplay function beyond housing a robbable cash register, it stands out as a prominent and decorative location in town. A sign by the nearby railway directs travelers toward the hotel, and its name is proudly displayed in bold gold lettering across the second-floor exterior.

The building has two entrances on the ground level — a main entrance at the front and a backdoor that leads through a small area beneath the staircase into the main lobby. Inside, the first floor features the front desk and cash register , staffed by a hotel worker , as well as two accessible rooms with varying décor. The second floor includes three additional rooms and a small balcony that overlooks the street.

Each room in the hotel has a unique interior, though most contain a mirror and a bed, giving the hotel a lived-in and somewhat personalized appearance. While it lacks interactive use beyond robbing, the Golden Nugget Hotel adds to the visual charm and atmosphere of Bronze City’s western setting.

Previously, this saloon did not have a Piano or any other instrument , making it the only bar without one prior to the re-model. Above the fireplace lies a mounted bear head with angry eyebrows. The gate in the fireplace is actually the Forest of Bones gate found in the Ancient Descent . Same with the fences at the Church . Grizzly Saloon has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) .

A different developer-exclusive version of the Guitar, the Heavy Guitar, is reskinned and has a different sound set.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Guitars use the body and the sound hole to amplify the vibrations of the strings. The Guitar has four strings, while most guitars at the time would have had six strings. This odd trait is shared with the Banjo , and could be based off of four-stringed tenor instruments, which were commercially sold in the early 1900s. The Guitar has 7 frets, while normal acoustic guitar have between 18 and 24 frets. Four-stringed guitar-inspired instruments were made at home or improvised from cigar boxes, and used in the 1800s. The Guitar was added in the 3.4 Update. The Guitar's sound hole doesn't actually lead into the body, instead having a shallow cup-like part over it. The Guitar is slightly out of tune from the rest of the instruments, making it a less optimal choice for a band, as it stands out instead of making a blend. The first Guitar was purchased at auction for $400,000. The Guitar has a sell price of $3500 but can only be sold in the Black Market .

The Guycot Chain Carbine is a fast-firing, chain-fed rifle known for its high capacity and unique design, offering an unconventional alternative to standard lever-action guns.

This unique fully-automatic repeating carbine features an 80-round internal capacity with a unique design. Boasting a high rate of fire at the cost of low damage and a lengthy reload, the Guycot Chain Carbine appeals to those who prefer accuracy by volume. You are bound to kill off your targets eventually.

Notably, its bullet-velocity is among the lowest currently ingame. Even in close range you might end up having to adjust aim slightly in the direction where your target is moving to correct your bullets' trajectory. Unpredictable movement can still throw off some of your shots.

Much like some other weapons that greatly reduce mobility, the Guycot Carbine is more effective on Horseback than on foot in most situations. The high fire rate and extreme capacity allow for suppressive fire regardless of accuracy. This is also a solid choice for defending Forts as you can stand on the walls and rain down fire all over, including areas outside of the Gatling Guns' limited view.

Trivia [ ]

Like the Volcanics , the Guycot Carbine fires self-contained caseless ammunition which fires the entire bullet. It also has a pistol variant. When reloading the Guycot Chain Carbine, the chain inside the firearm is visible inside. Only the portion of the chain that can be seen is modeled, and the chain does not move, likely for performance reasons. The real-life Guycot Chain Carbine was designed by Paulin Gay and Henri Guénot. They originally tried to patent the gun to the military, but failed due to the Rocketball projectile being too weak. It was then sold to civilians which accumulated few sales. The Chain Carbine is a scaled-up Guycot Chain Pistol , and shares a display case in the Auction House with it. At 80 rounds, the Chain Carbine has the highest capacity of any firearm in game, also giving it the longest full reload in game. The first Guycot Chain Carbine was purchased at auction for $650,000. The Guycot Chain Carbine cannot be sold to any NPC vendors, however it has a sell price of $10500 and can be sold in the Black Market . Like all other auction items, it cannot be dropped. "Guycot" is pronounced "Ghee-coh", not Guy-cot. (guy-cot is the more recognizable pronunciation)

This exotic French firearm can carry 30 rounds and is capable of a high rate of fire. After players fire all their rounds, they better watch out, because each chain link in the Guycot Chain Pistol needs to be reloaded by hand.

With one of the fastest firing speeds of any weapon, firing only fractions of a second slower than most fanned revolvers, this feature is offset by low damage, harsher recoil, lower accuracy, and steeper damage falloff than its Carbine model. While not a pistol for landing accurate, powerful hits, the sheer volume of shots that it is capable of putting out can leave anything riddled with holes, and the high capacity can be reloaded fairly quickly.

Trivia [ ]

The Volcanic Pistol shares many similarities with the Guycot Chain Pistol, both being parts of Pistol/Rifle sets which caseless ammunition. In real life, some models of this pistol had chains extending into the handle, resulting in it being capable of holding 40 rounds. The Guycot Chain Pistol, Carbine, and 1855 Shotgun all share the low strength of 12 damage per projectile (without dropoff). With dropoff, the Pistol is close to dealing the least possible damage in the game, aside from shotgun pellets after dropoff, which can deal as low as 4.2 damage, and the Blow Dart Gun , which deals 5 damage. The Guycot Chain Pistol has a sell price of $7000 but cannot be sold to any vendor NPCs . Like all other auction items, it used to be droppable. It has the second highest ammo capacity and second slowest full reload in the game, second only to its carbine variant. In the current player market, the pistol stands as the cheapest Auction Gun. The Guycot Chain Pistol is the only automatic pistol in the game that is not magazine-fed. "Guycot" is pronounced "Ghee-coh".

Callahan's Revenge was The Wild West's first event : a temporary seasonal change to the map, featuring decorations and atmospheric changes.

This event was story based, and featured a handful of characters, their actions, and the consequences, leading to the West being haunted by a terrifying monster.

Changes [ ]

The Callahan's Revenge update introduced eternal night, the TNT & Detonator , the Wendigo , a ghost, and a new area of the map, Callahan's Manor ! This building related to the storyline, and inside you could find Katherin Callahan , the ghost lady. She would scream and sprint towards players who got too close. Upon contact, she would disappear, dealing 70 damage to the player she hit while going out. Katherin would also spawn at the graveyard . The map update also included numerous pumpkins, spiders, and other spooky decorations around Bronze City and the rest of the map. During this event, it is known that the Bronze City Saloon Piano played Myuu's "Wasted Wonderland", as a special spooky tune.

The event also introduced the Wendigo , which spawned in Pinewood Hills , Callahan's Manor and the graveyard . It was extremely hard to finish off and would run towards players, often killing the unprepared in a single blow. It also had an incredible 3200 health, the most of any creature to be added to the game up to that point. Upon death, there was a chance for it to drop a very rare Wendigo hat.

Callahan's Manor [ ]

Callahan's Manor was a sublocation added in this event. The manor contained a Wendigo spawn, Halloween decorations, and Katherin Callahan 's ghost. Prior to the event, it was the much smaller Delores' Ranch .

Event Items [ ]

Callahan's Top Hat

Inside the basement of Callahan's Manor were the Remains of Katherin Callahan . Players could bring the Remains to Dead Man's Rest , and bury them in an unmarked grave. This would give you Callahan's Top Hat, and put Katherin's ghost to rest. Players attempting to finish this quest would be hindered by her angered ghost, both in the Manor, and at the graveyard.

Wendigo Hat

To obtain the Wendigo Hat, players needed to kill the Wendigo, who had a 50% chance of dropping its skull as an obtainable hat.

TNT & Detonator

The TNT & Detonator mission was introduced in this event, a powerful two-item explosive device, created by Robert John Hudson , and hidden away in Hunt and Trade . It remains obtainable to this day.

Halloween Lore [ ]

The Wild West Halloween event was very story-driven and included several missions and the Wendigo enemy.

"The Wendigo is a creature of selfishness. Always eats more and more and is never full. Always emaciated, it never gives, it only eats and takes."

Leonard Callahan was a rich man, owning the Plantation . On a hunting trip, Callahan finds the skull of a Wendigo in the forest , which he then brings home to study. His wife, Katherin Callahan, is disgusted by it, so Leonard puts it away in the attic.

However, the skull's supernatural aura attracts Callahan and convinces him it's not something that can be scientifically explained, so he turns to Native American legends and rituals. Callahan quickly becomes obsessed with the Wendigo , wanting to prove that it is real, and harness its power for himself and his family.

Callahan starts by mutilating and sacrificing animals in his basement, but to no avail. The animals do not have the right souls. He then decides to try an experiment on his wife, accidentally killing her. Callahan's ritual succeeds, and he goes mad with grief over his actions and the influence of the skull, leaving behind the manor, believing that he can still hear Katherin's screams. Katherin does not receive a proper burial, and so her spirit haunts the Manor, where her Remains lie, and the Church, where she should have been buried. Leonard Callahan's obsessive wish finally comes true, twisting him into a Wendigo and proving its existence.

Two of the event's "Quests" tied directly into this story, one to kill the Wendigo, and one to bury Katherin's Remains. A third quest gave backstory to R. J. Hudson and his Hunt and Trade outpost, however is unrelated to the Callahans', Hudson having died 57 years before Katherin's death.

Delores Callahan is their daughter, who luckily survived, and didn't have much part in the Callahan's Revenge story. She lives her days selling and breeding horses at Delores' Ranch , where she can be found today.

Trivia [ ]

This event marked the introduction of the Wendigo , and featured the first bits of story present in game. Leonard and Katherin's story could be read from a series of Mysterious Notes found scattered throughout Callahan's Manor. The Symbol that was used to sacrifice Katherin has been seen several times since, and a similar ritual could be performed in the Forest of Bones event to use a monster's bones and an equivalent soul to bring the monster back to life. It will likely play a part in future Halloween events as well. Zachariah Henry is seen holding the Navy Revolver in the game's thumbnail, but the revolver would not be added until the event ended. 2019 Halloween had the first rendition of seasonal themed trains, with the first version of a ghost train circling the map. The Inscriptions located on R. J. Hudson grave read "went out with a bang", hinting that the player has to blow up his grave in order to receive Hudson's key. Callahan's Top Hat was one of the few hats that wasn't affected by a bug which stopped players from changing the hat's height unless removed.

Puerto Dorado Halloween Decorations For Day Of The Dead.

To coincide with Halloween, various locations received decorations befitting of a spooky atmosphere. Bronze City was filled with its usual Halloween decorations of spiders, jack-o'-lanterns, and cobwebs. Puerto Dorado 's decorations were strung along buildings and arches. These also appeared in Fort Spencer and on the Steamboat . Callahan's Manor was surprisingly undecorated as compared to Callahan's Revenge , and was instead boarded up. During the event, the Saloon Pianos and Calliope Steam Organ played Myuu's Wasted Wonderland , instead of the normal Cowboy Intermezzo.

The Buried Library got its own spawn location and Bank Storage to assist with the event. Callahan's Manor was updated, with some of its windows and the entrance blocked off by wood planks, and could only be entered by breaking the windows. Nighttime was doubled during the event to allow players to have more time to complete the event, lasting just as long as day. Deer were temporarily removed from the game, possibly to make obtaining raw Animal Meat or Bone Currency more difficult, or potentially to reduce lag.

Bronze City Halloween Decorations.

Forest of Bones [ ]

The Forest of Bones.

The Forest of Bones, also known as the "Underworld", was a new location added in the 2020 Halloween Event.

The Forest of Bones' original location is still visible from Howling Peak . The only way in currently is through exploits or glitches. The Gerald and Skeleton Horses that used to be there have been removed, but the area still exists. Developer Tyridge77 has indicated that there may eventually be a secret way to return.

Entering the Forest of Bones [ ]

Players could enter the Forest of Bones by going to the Buried Library. In the Buried Library, one would find a portal in the ground, in the trapdoor in front of the altar. If one was to jump into the portal with a piece of Raw Animal Meat (meaning it could not be cooked using a Camp Fire ), they would be teleported to the Forest of Bones via. a mysterious portal in the Buried Library . Failure to have animal meat would result in players being flung out of the portal, and taking significant fall damage on impact. The meat was consumed upon entering the portal.

Upon entering, players landed on a glowing purple Symbol , along with some smashed columns, desks, a human skull, and large gates, featuring glowing red epsilon, delta, and omega symbols. The words "Sinners can never leave" were carved above this gate.

Description [ ]

The Forest of Bones was a gloomy place. Large amounts of bones, including Wendigo -like ribs, horned skulls, and large bovine skulls, were littered throughout the area with various odd stone pillars, carved stone skulls, and broken columns. What appeared to be large red trumpet coral could be found growing near pillars and along the ground, as well as several large leafless trees. These trees had red ribbons hanging in the branches, similar to the ribbons tangled in the Wendigo's antlers. As for animals , several wild Skeleton Horses roamed the area which were a part of the event. There was also a shallow lake there, full of fairly small Gerald .

The Forgotten Sanctuary with an active portal.

Leaving the Forest of Bones [ ]

Players could leave the main forest through another large gate found at a sublocation called the "Forgotten Sanctuary", this one built with brickwork similar to the Temple of the Egg . Here, they would find more Skeleton Horses in the valley below, as well as a shallow lake spanning most of the valley, full of Geralds . Statues of knights could be seen in various states of disrepair, their story long forgotten, as well as a castle looming over the valley to the northwest. Across the lake were various pillars, more stonework with decorations from The Temple of the Egg, and stairs up into a tunnel carved out of the end of the valley. Through this tunnel was the Forgotten Sanctuary, which featured a larger and slightly more detailed Symbol, as well as the exit portal, and two Notes . Outlaws were incapable of traveling through this portal, as "Sinners can never leave", and would have to reset to escape. If a Lawman or Citizen entered the portal, they would land back in the Buried Library. One thing to note is that if an Outlaw lassoed and dragged a Lawman/Citizen to where the portal was, the portal would reappear for the innocent player, allowing for the Outlaw to use it as well.

Lore [ ]

Five new notes were available in this update.

A notice, warning the people of Bronze City about monsters lurking beyond, could be found posted to a few lampposts near the Doctor's Office . A prominent log by the Mysterious Traveler in the Forgotten Sanctuary, titled "Closer than ever", detailing "their" findings, and cause of using the power of the gods to conjure beasts from the depths of the realm the Forest of Bones is in. A mysterious ritual found in the Forgotten Sanctuary, titled "arbor deos". It is written in Latin, and mentions tree gods, a triangle of men, and the antlers of a stag. A log, written by the "Mysterious Traveler", and found in the Forgotten Sanctuary, pinned to the wall behind the exit portal. It talks about how close they were to learning how to summon and control creatures of the underworld, notably close to Leonard Callahan 's goal of using the power of the Wendigo. A scrap of paper, located in the Buried Library. It describes the ritual to summon your own Skeleton Horse, and is likely the result of the Mysterious Traveler's research.

A sign in Bronze City's Cattle Pens also implies that the Wendigo ate Bronze City's Cows , and possibly all the Deer in the wild. "Help! Monsters ate our cows!"

Skeleton Horse [ ]

The Skeleton Horse that you have  to kill for the Skeleton Drops.

One of the Event Items that was obtainable from the event was the Skeleton Horse . To obtain the Skeleton Horse, players had to go to the Forest of Bones. In the Forest of Bones, one would find multiple Skeleton Horses . Players had to kill these horses, and obtain their bones. There were five skeleton parts that were needed which are as follows: the Skeleton Horse Head, Thigh, Body, Shoulder and Leg.

These parts now drop on death, though did not during the event.

Skeleton Horses were always guaranteed to drop a random skeleton part. When all the parts were obtained, players had to travel back to the Buried Library.

Skeleton Parts on the table.

To perform the ritual to obtain the horse, players had to first place the various pieces of bones onto the table located in the Buried Library. Then, they had to spawn one of their horses close to the table and kill it. The horse that was sacrificed would be gone forever, so it was wise to pick a cheap horse. Afterwards, a popup would alert them that they've obtained the Skeleton Horse.

Wendigo [ ]

The Wendigo Holster.

The Wendigo made a return in this event. The item featured from it was the Wendigo Holster.

One could get this item by defeating the Wendigo, which would spawn in multiple locations around the map at midnight. Once it had been defeated, it would drop a number of holsters between two and eight. Upon picking up a holster, a message would appear notifying the player to their new holster. The holster could only be obtained once, permanently unlocking it. Alongside the new holster, killing the Wendigo also had a 10% chance of dropping the 2019 Wendigo Hat. The hat was also permanent.

Killing the Wendigo was a difficult endeavor, as it had 3200 health, dealt 80 damage a hit, threw players very high, often killing in one hit with fall damage, was extremely fast, and had the uncanny ability to teleport. It was recommended to bring along a large party when taking one down, or to cheese the fight, as you only had around six minutes to kill the beast, as they spawned at Midnight, and vanished at 6am on the dot.

Witch Doctor [ ]

Witch Doctor NPC.

The Witch Doctor's Table, featuring both new masks.

The Witch Doctor was a static NPC in the Buried Library. The only purpose of this NPC was to sell two new cosmetic items that were added with the update: the Plague Doctor Mask and the Jack-O'-Lantern Mask, each costing 25 Animal Bones. To purchase these masks from the Witch Doctor, you had to obtain these bones and hold E or F when near them to select which mask you wished to trade for. You could only unlock each mask once, at which point it would reject further attempts to trade for the masks. You could obtain the Animal Bones by killing any Animal on the map. Animal Bones stack up to 50, and do not drop upon death. It was advised to purchase the Jack O' Lantern mask because it is not entirely cosmetic, it functions as a Lantern without taking up any inventory slots.

Trivia [ ]

The red omega symbol at the entrance to the Forest can also be seen in the trailer for The Wild Seas, an unfinished, unreleased, and lost game by Starboard Studios. The symbol could also be seen on the door for the second entrance to the Forest of Bones. The Symbol in the main map has almost always appeared as orange, including inside of the Buried Library when glowing, Oddly enough, the Forest's Symbols all appeared purple. One Wendigo Gate was also previously seen with a green Symbol at Callahan's Manor, for unknown reasons. The Forest of Bones was displayed on the map as north of Fort Spencer, despite being northwest of Howling Peak. Santa's Workshop was located where the map showed the Forest to be, though the Workshop has since been removed. Callahan was suspiciously uninvolved. There are several theories as to why, though he does appear as the Wendigo during the event, and many players suspect him of being the "Mysterious Traveler". The developers did end up reusing the Forest of Bones in the Halloween 2021 Sinners Moon event, as well as during the Halloween 2022 event. The forest can be seen northwest of Howling Peak. Use Binoculars or a Scope and Cinematic Mode for a slightly better view. Dorado's decorations resembled traditional Day of the Dead (a.k.a Dia De Los Muertos) "Papel Picados", which are paper flags depicting scenes of loved ones or events.

Changes [ ]

In this update, Tribal Forest received an overhaul, with the creation of new hills and a river. Silver Hill was removed, the Abandoned Cabin was relocated, and Tribal Village was abandoned. A new settlement, Silvertown , was established on the river, close to a ruined fort and the Little Rock Reservation , which became the area's new spawn location . Fort Tyler's name was changed to Ashburn Prison Camp .

Like previous Halloween events, towns received some spooky decorations, though not as many as in previous years. Pieces of a colossal skeleton were found in the sands of the Great Desert , though it is not known how they got there.

The update affected many other things, including Ore positioning and respawn rates. To view more about what changed, please visit the Versions page .

The event's focus was around the blood-red moon that caused an eerie light to settle over the world of the West, bringing the Wendigo with it. It also opened the Ancient Descent, a tunnel leading from the waterfall near Pinewood Hills and Whispering Summit to the Forest of Bones , allowing the Skeletons to leave the Forest and enter the world above.

Skeletons [ ]

An army of Skeletons used the Gates at the Ancient Descent to enter The Wild West . Returning to the land of the living to retrieve the Skeleton Horses stolen from them the year before, they were armed with Peacekeeper Revolvers , Winchester Rifles , and one with a Sharps Rifle . They wore various combinations of cloak-like ponchos, black Stetsons, and Sombreros. The Skeletons could be killed to obtain the Joyful Pumpkin, Cursed Lantern , and Piles of Bones.

Piles of Bones were the items needed to open the gate to the Forest of Bones . Once players collected thirty, they could open the gates of Hell at the bottom of the Descent and enter the Forest of Bones.

Forest of Bones [ ]

The Forest of Bones, which was the location of the previous year's Halloween event , was altered slightly since the last time players were able to visit. The Gerald and Skeleton Horses found in the area previously were both removed, and the monstrous Zombie Bears took their place. Skeletons stood guard around the Forest and the Forgotten Sanctuary , defending the Legendary Skeleton stationed within. The Mysterious Notes left by the Mysterious Traveler during the previous event were removed.

Once players entered the Forest through the Gates of Hell, there was no turning back. The only ways out were through the portal in the Forgotten Sanctuary or through death.

Legendary Skeleton [ ]

The Legendary Skeleton was the event's main boss. It protected the portal that players could use to go back to the West. Because of its high health, powerful Volcanic Pistol , and magical abilities to halt and reflect bullets, it was one of the West's most formidable foes. Its size and glowing eyes only made it more intimidating.

In order to escape the Forest, players had to band together to fight the skeletal menace. When defeated, it opened the exit portal for approximately 15 minutes and dropped the Cursed Volcanic Pistol and Ceremonial Dagger , among other things. After 15 minutes, another Legendary Skeleton would spawn.

Wendigo [ ]

Under the power of the Sinner's Moon, the Wendigo returned to The Wild West for a third time. It spawned every night at 6PM and despawned at 6AM if not killed. When killed, the Wendigo had a chance to drop three exclusive event items, being:

Wendigo Holster (100% chance) Wendigo Horse (25% chance; must hit last shot) Wendigo Mask (15% chance)

The Wendigo Holster was guaranteed to drop every time the Wendigo is killed. The Wendigo Hat was a bit more rare. To get the Wendigo Horse , the player had to deal the last hit to the Wendigo, killing it. However, it only had 25% chance of being obtained.

The Wendigo had various abilities, including its powerful attacks that could gravely wound players and send them hurtling through the air, teleportation, and a static fuzz that clouded the vision of the player the Wendigo was targeting.

This beast could spawn at Pinewood Hills , the Temple of the Egg , the Great Desert , the Swamp , or Tribal Forest .

No notes appear in this event, except for an Easter Egg unrelated to the story.

The Undead Skeletons have entered the West to exact vengeance on the living for the theft of their Skeleton Horses. A Dagger implied to belong to Leonard Callahan , or one of his family members, can be found dropped from the fight in the Forgotten Sanctuary. Similarly, the fight also drops the Cursed Volcanic Pistol , which deals double damage to the Skeleton NPCs, and glows with flame. The Wendigo returns once more, and now has a chance to spawn in the Great Desert . The inhabitants of Silvertown report strange sightings and happenings surrounding flying objects and green flashes.

Unidentified Flying Objects [ ]

During the event, UFOs flew overhead, stopping and hovering before darting off to their next location. While "stopped", they would occasionally shoot down a tractor beam, which would cause a green laser explosion effect. At the centre of these explosions, the Laser Cannon could be found and used by any player. The Laser Cannon dropped on death, and could not be stored in the Bank .

Rewards [ ]

Event tools, cosmetics, weapons, and horses that could be won during the event.

Removed 50 Pile Of Bone Stacks [ ]

Originally during the 3.5.0 iteration of the Halloween event, a 50 Pile of Bones stack was required to open the Gates of Hell. Shortly after the original release, the Developers updated the game to the 3.5.1 iteration and changed the required amount from 50 to 30, at the same time making obtaining any stacks with the sizes 31-50 impossible.

31-50 Stacks Merging

31-49 Pile of Bone stacks do not merge with other stacks to create 50s, they'll instead create multiple stacks with a limit of 30.

Example 1: If players move a 33 Pile of Bones stack into a storage compartment which already has a 6 stack, it will form a 30 stack and a 9 stack.

Example 2: If players move a 20 Pile of Bones stack into a storage compartment which already has a 31-50 Pile of Bones stack nothing will happen.

Example 3: If players move a 50 Pile of Bones stack into a storage compartment which already has a 30, nothing will happen. There is no gap which the 50 will try to fill.

Example 4:  If players move a 50 Pile of Bones stack into a storage compartment which already has a 20 stack they will merge to create two 30 Pile of Bone stacks, and a extra 10 stack.

Trivia [ ]

The Ancient Descent was visible several versions earlier, but was blocked off by a massive boulder. The Icon and Thumbnail feature the Legendary Skeleton copying The Outlaw Josey Wales ' pose. The Joyful Pumpkin and Playful Pumpkin are nearly identical, but the Playful Pumpkin is a little larger than Joyful Pumpkin. Unlike previous Events , Sinner's Moon was extended to the end of the month, after being delayed and coming out a week late. Previous events only lasted a week from the holiday's date. The red fog caused by the blood moon hovered everywhere at night, making travel without a light difficult. This is the first event to have an event-exclusive gun, and an event-exclusive melee weapon. However, the North Pole event introduced the first event-exclusive weapon, the Candy Cane . Blood moons are a type of lunar eclipse where a full moon reflects red light while being eclipsed. Blood moons are commonly seen as bad omens, and connected to the supernatural. In video games, they often signify dangerous events, and power up undead creatures. When the Wendigo despawned, it used the Skeleton Horse vanish effect. This effect was also used whenever a Skeleton died or spawned, though the Wendigo continued to use its spawn effect from previous years. The Wendigo Horse originally only had a 10% chance of being granted to the player who killed the Wendigo.

Changes [ ]

In this update, Tribal Forest received an overhaul, with the creation of new hills and a river. Silver Hill was removed, the Abandoned Cabin was relocated, and Tribal Village was abandoned. A new settlement, Silvertown , was established on the river, close to a ruined fort and the Little Rock Reservation , which became the area's new spawn location . Fort Tyler's name was changed to Ashburn Prison Camp .

Like previous Halloween events, towns received some spooky decorations, though not as many as in previous years. Pieces of a colossal skeleton were found in the sands of the Great Desert , though it is not known how they got there.

The update affected many other things, including Ore positioning and respawn rates. To view more about what changed, please visit the Versions page .

The event's focus was around the blood-red moon that caused an eerie light to settle over the world of the West, bringing the Wendigo with it. It also opened the Ancient Descent, a tunnel leading from the waterfall near Pinewood Hills and Whispering Summit to the Forest of Bones , allowing the Skeletons to leave the Forest and enter the world above.

Skeletons [ ]

An army of Skeletons used the Gates at the Ancient Descent to enter The Wild West . Returning to the land of the living to retrieve the Skeleton Horses stolen from them the year before, they were armed with Peacekeeper Revolvers , Winchester Rifles , and one with a Sharps Rifle . They wore various combinations of cloak-like ponchos, black Stetsons, and Sombreros. The Skeletons could be killed to obtain the Joyful Pumpkin, Cursed Lantern , and Piles of Bones.

Piles of Bones were the items needed to open the gate to the Forest of Bones . Once players collected thirty, they could open the gates of Hell at the bottom of the Descent and enter the Forest of Bones.

Forest of Bones [ ]

The Forest of Bones, which was the location of the previous year's Halloween event , was altered slightly since the last time players were able to visit. The Gerald and Skeleton Horses found in the area previously were both removed, and the monstrous Zombie Bears took their place. Skeletons stood guard around the Forest and the Forgotten Sanctuary , defending the Legendary Skeleton stationed within. The Mysterious Notes left by the Mysterious Traveler during the previous event were removed.

Once players entered the Forest through the Gates of Hell, there was no turning back. The only ways out were through the portal in the Forgotten Sanctuary or through death.

Legendary Skeleton [ ]

The Legendary Skeleton was the event's main boss. It protected the portal that players could use to go back to the West. Because of its high health, powerful Volcanic Pistol , and magical abilities to halt and reflect bullets, it was one of the West's most formidable foes. Its size and glowing eyes only made it more intimidating.

In order to escape the Forest, players had to band together to fight the skeletal menace. When defeated, it opened the exit portal for approximately 15 minutes and dropped the Cursed Volcanic Pistol and Ceremonial Dagger , among other things. After 15 minutes, another Legendary Skeleton would spawn.

Wendigo [ ]

Under the power of the Sinner's Moon, the Wendigo returned to The Wild West for a third time. It spawned every night at 6PM and despawned at 6AM if not killed. When killed, the Wendigo had a chance to drop three exclusive event items, being:

Wendigo Holster (100% chance) Wendigo Horse (25% chance; must hit last shot) Wendigo Mask (15% chance)

The Wendigo Holster was guaranteed to drop every time the Wendigo is killed. The Wendigo Hat was a bit more rare. To get the Wendigo Horse , the player had to deal the last hit to the Wendigo, killing it. However, it only had 25% chance of being obtained.

The Wendigo had various abilities, including its powerful attacks that could gravely wound players and send them hurtling through the air, teleportation, and a static fuzz that clouded the vision of the player the Wendigo was targeting.

This beast could spawn at Pinewood Hills , the Temple of the Egg , the Great Desert , the Swamp , or Tribal Forest .

No notes appear in this event, except for an Easter Egg unrelated to the story.

Changes [ ]

This small update featured the revamp and remodel of the Mule Shotgun and the Sawed-Off Shotgun , along with an "Occult" variant of each. Accuracy, spread, and headshot damage were all buffed, however, recoil was greatly increased in return. The Guycot Chain Carbine and Pistol received ammo capacity buffs.

The Occult Double Barrels could be found around the map (near Fort Henry and at the Endeavor ) Complementing these locations were notes surrounding the lore of the given structure and how the landmarks ended up in the West, as well as two notes from Kazuhira, explaining what happened to the projects.

The Skeleton Horse was briefly brought back to the game. This was a rare drop from the Legendary Skeleton but was removed shortly after launch for reasons not specified.

The Forest of Bones ' gate opened again, featuring only the Zombie Bears and the Legendary Skeleton stalking the underworld, since the Skeletons were defeated after the events of Sinner's Moon . There was no cost to enter; the gate permanently slid into the open position. Blood Moons were also far more common, and always spawned the Wendigo .

Event Items [ ]

Occult Sawed Off [ ]

The Occult Sawed Off could be found on board The Endeavor . It is the result of a failed ritual to create a shotgun for hunting witches and demons. It appears similar to the Sawed-Off Shotgun, but features dark metal hammers and spikes, as well as glowing runes all over the barrel. A chain connects the receiver and pistol grip, and the ends of the barrels are blown out, instead of "Sawed Off" as the name implies.

Occult Mule [ ]

The Occult Mule could be found resting on the spiral symbol within the stone circle. It is an exquisite example of a shotgun crafted to slay demons and witches. Unlike the Occult Sawed Off, it was successfully finished, featuring ribs decorating the forestock and forming the rear sights. The front sight glows red, while purple runes decorate the barrels. The hammers are made of bone, and the stock has a crude blade affixed to the bottom side, held in place with a chain, and wrapped tight with bandages or cloth.

Pumpkin Masks [ ]

Zombie Bears once again drop Playful Pumpkin hats, and can be found in the Forest of Bones, along with the Legendary Skeleton dropping Scornful Pumpkin hats and Playful Pumpkin hats. The 2020 Jack O' Lantern Mask could be found in the Desert Mine , next to the Delorean , with the prompt "I can pick this up?". Glitched Pumpkins have information listed at the bottom of this page.

Ceremonial Dagger [ ]

The dagger was once again dropped by the Legendary Skeleton.

Runescape Party Hat [ ]

A unique hat was awarded to any player that deals over 90% of the damage to the Legendary Skeleton upon its death. As the name suggests, his hat originates from Runescpape, a fantasy MMORPG game. (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)

Occult Lantern [ ]

This purple lantern had a chance of being unlocked after the Legendary Skeleton is killed. It is a smaller version of the ones found near the developer notes. After being held for a few seconds, the lantern slowly begins to cast a faint fog-like aura.

Plague Doctor Mask [ ]

A mask from the Halloween event in 2020, unlocked with a chance of being awarded to players who deal the killing blow to the Legendary Skeleton.

Wendigo Loot [ ]

The Wendigo once again dropped all the loot from previous years, including holsters, which were always dropped, the hat, which had a chance to drop, and a 25% chance of unlocking the Wendigo Horse upon landing the killing blow. When the Wendigo Horse was released, it did not have glowing eyes. These were eventually added after many player requests.

Developer Note [ ]

Olympia [ ]

DEVELOPER NOTE

Hi,

Many of you may not know, but once upon a time Starboard was working on a fantasy medieval sword fighting game. Obligation, frustration, obligation, frustration, obligation... Frustration. We benched the project since at the time Roblox's technology wasn't keeping up with what we wanted to do.

It was our fault that we didn't continue to pursue Olympia, but it was obligation and catastrophe (and a bit of Covid) that sealed its fate..

While I can't give you the game we promised,I can give you a glowing boomstick...
So, you're welcome I guess...

-Co-Founder, Kazuhira

The Wild Seas [ ]

DEVELOPER NOTE

Hi,
As you may have pieced together, The Wild Seas is still lost at sea... Or is it?

The world may never know the fate of The Endeavor and its crew, but at least you get a cool shotgun, right?

May this be a lesson to all sailors; not every expedition reaches its destination.

-Co-Founder, Kazuhira

Announcement [ ]

The event was announced in the community Discord on October 31, 2022, through this message:

Hi everyone,

First of all, happy Halloween! 🎃 I wanted to clarify a few things since everyone has been asking, "When is the Halloween update".  To keep it short,No, there is no large Halloween event this year.

That being said, I have been working on a very small Halloween update that hopefully you can still enjoy. I'm not sure exactly when I'll be done but I will let you know when. For now, enjoy Halloween and go spook some kids!

Removed Changes [ ]

Zombie Bears dropped the Playful Pumpkin, as both a hat and an item. The Legendary Skeleton dropped the Scornful Pumpkin hat, with a display line about bragging rights. At the beginning of the event, the Joyful Pumpkin was unobtainable, due to the absence of the Skeletons . The Scornful and Playful Pumpkins were later both "renamed" to Joyful. The Legendary Skeleton (briefly) had a chance of unlocking the Skeleton Horse . Further small patches happened, including changes to moving items between the Backpack and Hotbar .

Glitched Pumpkin Items [ ]

During the 3.6.21 iteration of the 2022 Halloween event when players picked up a pumpkin cosmetic, it turned into a item. This was fixed in the Halloween 2022 patch, no longer being obtained as an item, unlocking the hats instead, and being deleted when dropped. These item versions dropped on death and (still do) nothing, if players didn’t bank a pumpkin before the game updated to remove them it was lost forever. Pumpkins don't have a sell price.

As of Version 4.0, if you click on a Pumpkin item, the game will attempt to unlock the cosmetic without moving the item. The only actions you can perform on a Pumpkin item are discarding and moving it.

If you already have the cosmetic version unlocked, it will provide the error message "You've already unlocked the playful pumpkin hat." without affecting the item. (This message in particular is for the Playful Pumpkin)

Variants & Rarity

There are 3 variants of pumpkins:

Joyful - Dropped from Zombie Bears and the Legendary Skeleton , most common. Playful - Dropped from Zombie Bears and the Legendary Skeleton , second most common. Scornful - Dropped from the Legendary Skeleton .

Differentiating pumpkins

As of version 4.0 all the pumpkins were renamed, during the prior version every pumpkin was named "Joyful" and the actual name was the description, but now the name and description are the same for all pumpkins.

In the "batteries not included!" patch, the Scornful and Playful Pumpkin hats and items were changed, which renamed Scornful and Playful items and drops to "Joyful", which could not actually be unlocked. Because of this, every single item version of the pumpkins had "Joyful" as the name, but the actual variant as the description. In version 4.0, the Scornful, Playful, and Joyful Pumpkin hat items were renamed. In the prior version they were all named "Joyful" and had the actual variant listed as the description, but 4.0 updated all of the pumpkins to list the same name as their description.

Trivia [ ]

The Wild Seas was last teased through an April Fools' Day joke, in which a mock-up for the game was released, however, when the "game" finished "loading", a clip from Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" would instead play, a common internet trolling practice called "rickrolling". Screenshots of how Olympia would have looked were released by Kazuhira on Twitter in June of 2022. Various models from The Wild West could be seen, including the mysterious spiral decoration, and the strange coral from the Forest of Bones. Starboard Studios' "Dave's 2020 Vision" and "Snowball Fighting Simulator" are not present in the event, likely due to being completed. Prior to this update, the Mule and Sawed-Off were two different double-barreled mule-eared shotguns; now, they are modified versions of each other.

Notes

The event features one source of writing, Doctor Robert Lazarus' journal.

Robert Lazarus‘ journal

I find myself unable to bear the grief any longer. I look into my son’s eyes, and all I see is her, my beloved, stolen away by godless outlaws. My heart feels as though it has turned to stone, an ancient relic of the vibrant muscle it once was.

Today, young Everett, our precious son, preached a moving sermon about the acceptance of death, the acknowledgement of the eternal silence that follows. It’s poignant, but I cannot, will not accept. The silence scares me more than any mortal fear ever could. My dear Elizabeth deserves more than silence.

How I yearn for her laughter, the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke of the flowers she loved to tend. Death is not the end. It cannot be. There has to be a way to bring her back to this world. I must delve into the science behind the cessation of life.

I’ve been going over several theories, most absurd. Nryca’s Law of Life Conservation, capital nonsense… but Baxendal’s Prism of Life Resurgence? There may be potential therein. His obsession with electricity carries weight I neglected before - could lightning hold the key to resurrection?

A moment of inspiration has struck, quite literally. Could the power of thunder be harnessed? Could one use storm-kissed material to fuel a machine with such sublime energy?

Bronze City loves a good storm. If there is any place in the world we can harness so much raw electrical force, it’s there. We must move. Everett is not keen, but this is bigger than us now. He will understand, eventually.

My life has become my research, my research my life. Every storm, every legend, they are symbols of hope, almost holy in their potential power. Construction on the machine begins tomorrow. An end to the silence, my love. Soon.

Tonight, Everett warned me of seeking to usurp the natural order. The ones fiery pastor, now trembling at the sight of my work, raising a storm. But he will understand when he hears her laughter again, feels love. He will.

The machine is complete. It lives, and with it, the hope of returning Elizabeth to life blooms anew. Will it work? The next storm shall tell. Our thunderous reunion is imminent, my love.

Announcement [ ]

Hello everyone,

Happy Halloween! This year our team faced a difficult decision; do we continue working on the Progression Update, or delay it and spend the rest of the year creating Seasonal Events.

We ultimately decided that the best course of action is to continue forward with the Progression Update and not create a new Halloween Event this year.

However, we know that Halloween in The West is one of the most enjoyable times for our community. So, by suggestion and popular demand, we are bringing back last year's Halloween Event for a limited time.

We hope you enjoy, and we'll see you all soon, hopefully with good news about the Progression Update!

Changes [ ]

Schwarzlose Prototype Pistol . Lancaster Pistol . and Volcanic Pistols were rebalanced. A hug emote was added. The piano's idle song is changed to Myuu's "Wasted Wonderland" as it was in Callahan's Revenge .

Schwarzlose damage and magazine capacity reduced. Lancaster no longer one shots to head, but two shots to body. Dropoff pattern starts closer and ends far further. Volcanic headshot multiplier reduced to 1.5x from 2x and firerate when fanned got slightly . See individual pages for more details.

Announcement changelog [ ]

2023's Undead Legends has returned to The Wild West! Fight bosses scattered around the map and collect Event Limited items. Look out for Demon Hunter Jane, she might have a quest for you... Start your journey by speaking to the pastor in the church. And as a fun bonus, we've added the ability for players to hug each other! Happy Halloween! (Check your emotes)

Hotfix patch notes [ ]

43 minutes after the event released, a second balancing change was made.

"With this update some weapon data was transferred from our developer build to the live game. The changes were not properly tested and the following values should be more in-line with what is intended:"

Prototype Pistol [ ]

Bodyshot Decreased from 25 to 24

Headshot Increased from 48 to 52.8

Ammo Remains 7

The changes to the Prototype Pistol are intended to make the gun a more skillful tool rather than an undisputed god tier gun.

Lancaster Pistol [ ]

Bodyshot Increased from 44 to 50 Damage

Falloff Starts at 5 studs instead of 10

Lancaster one shotting at point blank was a little too powerful given its fire rate, however this change still allows it to 2-shot bodyshot at point blank.

Cursed Volcanic Pistol [ ]

Bodyshot Increased from 28 to 30

Small decrease of the firering rate when fanned

The Hammerless Revolver is a double-action revolver with a fast fire rate and fast reload, as well as fairly good accuracy.

With an asking price of $9,000, it's on the pricy side for Gun Store weapons. If you liked the Model3 and want something that packs a bit more of a punch, this gun might fill a holster. For players who enjoy the Navy Revolver but want more speed and accuracy, the Hammerless can work as a good alternative at the cost of some damage. This is one of the quieter guns, making it optimal for stealth, though it does take several shots to kill a player with.

Gallery [ ]

Mechanics [ ]

As a double-action revolver without a visible hammer, the Hammerless cannot be fanned. Compensating for this, it has a fast rate of fire, and fairly good accuracy, though has a low headshot multiplier. As a break-action revolver, it has a very fast reload, with just over half a second per bullet. It also has a unique snapping sound while firing, which may be harder to detect than the louder gunshots of other firearms. It also does not have an automatically indexed cylinder, similar to the Peacekeeper , Lemat , and the 1855 Revolving Shotgun , meaning partial reloads can result in attempting to fire empty chambers. In this case, firing will simply rotate the cylinder to the next position.

Changelog [ ]

Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format.

23/05/2021: The Hammerless Revolver is added to the game.

07/11/2021: Firerate reduced from ~160 Rounds per Minute to ~120 Rounds per Minute.

Trivia [ ]

The real-life counterpart of this gun is the .38 Smith and Wesson Safety Hammerless, which was designed for concealed carry, featuring a snubby barrel and a concealed hammer to be easy to hide and draw. The "Safety" comes from the grip safety, requiring the grips to be squeezed before the trigger can be pulled, resulting in the "lemonsqueezer" nickname. The Hammerless Revolver is a double action revolver, meaning it is cocked and fired by pulling the trigger. The Hammerless was the first truly double action revolver added. The Dragoon Pistol is a shotgun with no animations, and was single action in real life. The Navy Revolver is lever action. Like several other revolvers in-game, the Hammerless can be indexed to an empty chamber, resulting in dry fires. Unlike other revolvers that can dry fire, the Hammerless does not have an animation or audio for the hammer or the cylinder indexing, and will not make a noise when dry fired. This revolver was one of the first sidearms to have both front and rear sights. Despite its name, the revolver does have a hammer, it's just concealed inside of the frame. The Hammerless and the 1855 Revolving Shotgun were the first two guns revealed of the nine teased in the Auction House update.

The firing sound of the Harmonica Rifle is the tune that plays before a player's death. The first automatic rifle in The Wild West is loaded with twelve-round slide bars and has one of the fastest steady rates of fire for a primary weapon. Combined with the good accuracy, average damage, and reduced headshot damage, players armed with the Harmonica are bound to exterminate their targets eventually.

The Harmonica Rifle has one of the highest capacities of any firearm in the game, aside from the Gatling Guns , M16 , and Guycots . It was added during the 2019 August Update , alongside the Mule Shotgun and Horse Bow . It originally had a faster reload for even more rapid-firing fun. Due to the relatively low damage but above-average firing speed, it's often used at close to mid-ranges.

Trivia [ ]

The Harmonica Rifle gets its name from the slide bars it loads to hold and fire ammunition, which resemble harmonicas. The Harmonica Rifle is based off of Jonathan Browning's percussion fire harmonica rifles (Slide bar Repeating Rifles). Other harmonica guns also include various pistols made by other manufacturers with other slide configurations, such as vertical ones, or even with the barrels attached to the slide. The Harmonica Rifle has the slowest reload of all the magazine or clip fed firearms, but also the highest capacity magazines. Aside from the Guycots and Spitfire, the only other primaries that can shoot faster than the Harmonica Rifle are the Volcanic Rifles when fanned .

Sneak Peek [ ]

First teased in the sneak peeks channel on July 15th, 2019, captioned "Fishing, new Rifles and more Map regions on the way!"

In a subsequent message, members were encouraged to guess what the rifle was, and to use Discord's Mention feature to tell the developer if they figured it out.

It appeared to have a six chambered "harmonica", more closely resembling known models produced by J. M. Browning. By July 17th, it was revealed that the capacity would be doubled.

Factions guns reworks [ ]

With Version 3.1's release, factions were added, and much of the game's UI and effects were updated, including general gun handling, first person changes, and recoil. Especially notable among these reworks were sound changes.

The Harmonica originally had a much quieter sound, and a smoother harmonica release noise, however upon the reworks it was updated to use the same sounds as Fistful of Frags '.

Auction guns reworks [ ]

With 3.4's rebalances and addition of damage falloff, the Harmonica's damage was increased by five, allowing it to kill with two headshots when within 240 studs. Two days later, the headshot multiplier would be reduced to 1.8x, for a maximum of 45 headshot damage, instead of 50.

Real life Counterpart [ ]

The Wild West 's Harmonica Rifle description calls it the "First automatic rifle". It is directly based off of Johnathan Browning's Slide bar repeating rifles, which are more commonly known as harmonica rifles for the magazine-esque breechblocks which featured several chambers in a row. In real life, these rifles were not automatic, and while they did fire far faster than their single shot competitors, the harmonicas still had to be released, moved, and then locked into place by hand, before cocking and firing the next shot.

It provides atmospheric music for both the Auction House and the Grizzly Saloon , which previously was the only Saloon without a Piano . The Harpsichord, like most other instruments, runs Virtual Piano, and has built in MIDI support through the Bands UI. When not in use by a player, it plays an arrangement of Jean-Philippe Rameau's "Les Cyclopes", however in the 4.0 Update, The Harpsichord's idle song can be turned off in the options menu.

Trivia [ ]

Harpsichords were created in the Middle Ages, and went out of style in the 1700s, before getting a revival in popularity in the 1900s. The Auction House is either behind the times, or jumping on a new trend! Pianos strike strings inside with hammers, while harpsichords pluck the strings, resulting in a different sound caused by different internal mechanisms. This is the only instrument of its kind that you can find in-game. You may find other keyboard instruments in other buildings, but the only harpsichord is in the Auction House. "Les Cyclopes" is french for "The Cyclopes", referencing the mythological one-eyed Greek giants.

Mechanics [ ]

Sniper Mechanics [ ]

As a sniper weapon, the Hartford forces first person, and aims down the iron sights of the rifle. Unlike scoped sniper rifles, iron sight sniper rifles can be fired as long as right click is being held, including before the weapon is brought into aiming position. The rifle will fire straight when aiming down the sights, if fired too early, it will go off in the direction of the barrel.

The Hartford's sights are brought up quickest when standing still, and not pivoting. Players can hold Right Click to aim the rifle, which can be shot at any point during this animation. Players wishing to quickscope should learn how to time this so that they shoot while the barrel is lined up with the third person crosshairs, but before first person is forced, for best results. Movement also impacts this animation, with it being harsher the faster you are moving.

Pivoting Left - Moving the camera quickly to the left forces the rifle down Pivoting Right - Moving the camera quickly to the right forces the rifle up Walk Forward - When walking forwards [W], the Hartford will aim in fast, but not as fast as when standing still Walk Backwards - The rifle takes the longest time to scope in when walking backwards [S] Strafing - When walking left or right [A]/[D], the rifle will take a bit longer than walking forwards to aim, but faster than walking backwards

.45-70 Government Ammunition [ ]

Consumable shotgun ammo does not change any other mechanics of the gun's use. The ammo can be toggled by opening the Backpack and clicking on the stack of Shotgun .45-70 gov. When in use, instead of firing one heavy hitting round, the Hartford instead fires four tightly packed pellets, resulting in a notable damage increase if all four pellets hit. If all four pellets hit, as long as one of them hits as a headshot, enough damage will be dealt to instantly kill a player.

Bullet Penetration [ ]

The very high bullet penetration of the Hartford makes it one of the most reliable for firing through walls and objects, along with the Sharps Rifle , Lynx Bolt Action , and Martini Henry . Danger, Killer, Outlaw, and Faction member world markers can be seen through walls, floors, ceilings, and the like, and can be used to easily aim at users with the markers.

Fire Rate [ ]

The Hartford Rifle can fire after roughly 0.10 seconds of the aiming animation. Once fired, the gun will be held steady for roughly half to three quarters of a second before it can be lowered or reloaded.

Changelog [ ]

Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format.

Trivia [ ]

The real-life counterpart is a later model of the Sharps Rifle , known as the Shiloh Sharps 1874, designed to hunt buffalo. The Rifle takes its name from Hartford, Connecticut, where the factory that produced the 1874 Sharps Rifles was located. The Hartford's iron sights are known as Tang Sights. The Hartford has the lowest damage drop-off of any weapon in the game, starting to drop at nearly 4,000 studs. This rifle was the first of anything in the game to cost over $10,000 Bucks, and was the most expensive purchase prior to the Auction House and 1855 Revolving Shotgun . Players who use FPS Unlocker to gain unusually high frame rates may run into a bug caused by the unlocker that makes the Hartford aim in slow motion. Some graphical enhancers also bug out the first person sights. Looking closely at the player character’s hand whilst reloading will reveal a bullet being loaded into the chamber, albeit facing the wrong direction.

Health , stamina , and oxygen all appear at the bottom of the HUD UI, above the Hotbar . They regenerate over time and are beneficial when full.

Contents

1 Health 2 Stamina 3 Oxygen 4 Gallery 5 Trivia

Health [ ]

Health is represented by a green bar that decreases when players take damage. Many things may damage them, such as weapons , animals , and Wood Cutting . If their health hits 0%, they will die and a death message will appear on their screen. When they respawn, their health will automatically be set to 100%. If they don't have much health and feel vulnerable, they may use healing items to regenerate some or even all of their health, or wait while not in combat to regenerate.

Stamina [ ]

Stamina is a light blue bar that keeps players from constantly jumping everywhere. There is a quick cooldown after each time they jump. If they jump 5 times in a row, their stamina will reach 0% and they cannot jump. But don't worry, their stamina will eventually regenerate. Jumping once takes away 25% stamina, rolling to the side takes 30%, punching takes away 15%, blocking takes 5% per second, and kicking takes 40%. Stamina also regenerates more slowly when in combat. When running out of stamina, the bar changes from a darker blue, to purple, and finally to red. To boost stamina regeneration rate, they can use a stamina buff , which can be given to they by a Doctor . Stamina is also consumed quickly by steadying the scopes of the Sharps Rifle and the Spitfire Revolving Sniper . When their stamina is lower, their jumps are also shorter and less powerful, and their speed will decrease slightly while sprinting.

Horses also have stamina, represented by spurs. They provide a brief speed boost when used, and are activated by pressing Shift. If they are out of Spurs, the horse will shake and apply a red filter to their screen. If the horse is pushed further, it will throw the riders. Spurs regenerate fairly quickly.

Players can also increase their stamina through the Justice skill , which grants the Agility Stamina perk. This perk is unlocked at level 15, providing a +15% stamina boost, and it gradually increases with each level. At level 85, it reaches a maximum of +45% Agility Stamina. This allows players to perform more actions—such as jumping, rolling, or aiming—before running out of stamina.

Oxygen [ ]

Oxygen is a dark blue bar that takes the place of stamina when players are swimming. It will slowly run out over time when they are underwater. they can automatically regenerate their oxygen to 100% if they swim to the surface. If their oxygen runs out, they will lose 6 health every 0.5 seconds (-12 health per second). Wearing the Scuba Helm cosmetic halves the oxygen consumed while underwater.

The Exploration skill grants players the Swim Oxygen perk, which increases the amount of oxygen they can hold while underwater. This perk unlocks at level 10, providing +25% swim oxygen, and improves as the skill levels up. At level 70, players reach the maximum bonus of +75% swim oxygen, allowing for significantly longer dives, especially when paired with the Scuba Helm.

Trivia [ ]

Health has almost always been displayed as a green bar. Stamina, however, has also been displayed as a yellow bar in the past. Stamina impacts jump height and run speed. The lower a player's stamina, the lower their speed and jump height. Root Beer claims to improve stamina, however acts as a healing item instead. With the Progression Update (4.0) , various skill-based perks were introduced, such as Agility Stamina (from the Justice skill ) and Swim Oxygen (from the Exploration skill ).

Restricted Notes

The Heavy Guitar , commonly known as the Electric Guitar or Dev Guitar is a developer-only instrument which has been spotted in-use by various developers, community staff, and content creators.

The Guitar uses the electrical effect from Mjölnir and Thunderstruck Logs , though only while being played, and is a deep black and red. It uses sound effects reminiscent of an actual electric guitar. The electricity that appears is a visual pun: an "electric" guitar, rather than one that literally uses electricity to produce a sound.

Gallery

Trivia

The guitar cannot be seen plugged into an amplifier, as most electric guitars are. Instead, it has a sound hole like acoustic guitars. As shown in a video showcasing Xecular using the Heavy Guitar, it had the power to heal people at incredible speeds, making a kill near-impossible unless it was done in a single shot. The ability has since been removed. The Heavy Guitar was the successor to the Flute, as the Flute was previously the Developer-only instrument, which players can now buy from the Auction House. It is now one of several Developer-only instruments currently in the game.

The Henry Marksman retains the original 80 damage to the body, while dealing an impressive 160 damage to the head up-close (enough to one-shot a bison), which will drop off to 64 and 112 at range. The normal Martini Henry has a max headshot damage of 112 up close, while the Henry Marksman deals the same damage at range. This fast-reloading rifle shares the highest damage potential with the original rifle per shot to the body in the game. It remains effective at long ranges, with a very high bullet velocity, a scope, 'strongest' bullet penetration, and 100% accuracy. It has a slightly increased damage falloff range compared to the original Martini Henry Rifle, capping at a max range of 150 studs compared to the original rifle's 50 studs.

The Henry Marksman is exceptionally good for hunting. It is able to one-shot deer at any range, one-shot bison to the head up-close, and kill a bear/gator in 2-3 headshots (4-5 body shots). The high accuracy, both on foot and horseback, further benefit this gun's ability for hunting. The scope is also very helpful, allowing for highly accurate long-range shots.

Sniper Mechanics [ ]

The Henry Shotgun forces first-person view while aiming and cannot be fired while not aiming. Unlike scoped snipers, this iron-sight rifle/shotgun can fire at any point during the aiming animation, allowing for quickscoping. The Henry Shotgun's sights are brought up quickest when standing still and not pivoting. Players can hold Right Click to aim the rifle, which can be shot at any point during this animation. Players wishing to quickscope should learn how to time this so that they shoot while the barrel is lined up with the third-person crosshairs but before the first-person is forced, for the best results. Movement also impacts this animation, with it being harsher the faster you are moving.

Pivoting Left: Moving the camera quickly to the left forces the rifle down. Pivoting Right: Moving the camera quickly to the right forces the rifle up. Walk Forward: When walking forward [W], the Martini Henry will aim fast, but not as fast as when standing still. Walk Backwards: The rifle takes the longest time to scope in when walking backwards [S]. Strafing: When walking left or right [A] or [D], the rifle will take a bit longer than walking forwards to aim, but faster than walking backwards.

Fire Rate [ ]

The Henry Shotgun can fire after roughly 0.20 seconds of the aiming animation. Once fired, the gun will be held steady for roughly a full second before it can be lowered or reloaded. The full reloading animation takes around 3.3 seconds to complete, however can be cancelled as soon as the bullet is loaded, which only takes around 2.3 seconds.

In real life, After World War I, other firearms using the action would continue to be developed by Greener, including the harpoon gun featured in Jaws and a shotgun modification used by Egyptian prison guards. The Henry Shotgun appears very similar to the unmodified Martini Henry, a notable difference being the added muzzle device, lack of rear sight and an unshielded front sight.

Sublocations [ ]

Puerto Dorado [ ]

The first half of the newest city, Puerto Dorado was previously known as Fort Mercest . It features most of the stores and buildings that Bronze City also has, although notably missing a Sheriff , and a Mayor . Both of these features may arrive when the Upper District is added, although this is purely speculation.

Estación Puerto Dorado [ ]

The Train Station was introduced in the Progression Update (Version 4.0) . It can be robbed by pick locking either the cash register or the safe.

Docks [ ]

A small shore just north of Puerto Dorado, these docks are the boarding point for the Steamboat, and head off into the water. Multiple Building Plots can be seen at the Docks.

Remains of a Pirate Ship [ ]

The remains of the pirate ship can be found in the river just outside of Puerto Dorado

River [ ]

This river stems from the large body of water north of Puerto Dorado, and runs to the lake found over the Lake Cave . The Steamboat travels up and down this river, which divides the Highlands and The Highland Plains , and feeds into the Swamp . A small stream also joins the river from the Tribal Forest . The head of the river can be found at The Docks, and is a large expanse of water full of fish .

La Grande (Legacy) [ ]

A large steamboat that ships gold from Puerto Dorado to the Docks that turn just around north of Bronze City . It features a floating Saloon . A vault can also be found on the bottom deck, which can be robbed for five gold bars, worth $500.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Quarry , while appearing to be part of the Highlands, is actually part of The Great Desert. Puerto Dorado and the Highlands are unfinished, their missing parts located across the river in the unreleased Highland Plains and Upper District. The Highlands occupy a strange space that curves around The Great Desert on all sides except to the south, where the Plantation is located instead. The pre-release filler for the Highlands had Fort Mercest and the words "BLACKWATER" carved into the ground, both Red Dead Redemption references . In the Medium Devblog , Tyridge77 stated "~ 80% done, Early to mid December estimated release" in regards to the Highlands, although they are already released. It is possible he was referring to the Highland Plains & Upper District , a long awaited and anticipated update. Giving its higher altitude compared to the Great Desert, and it position near the river, along with the presence of trees, low lying grass, and redder clay, the Highlands could be based off the Rio Bravo county of New Austin from Red Dead Redemption. The presence of Joshua Trees also makes it similar to Joshua Tree National Park in California, and Gaptooth Ridge from Red Dead Redemption. In the Progression Update (4.0) , the pirate boat was moved to the Swamp and no longer moves. It was replaced by the remains of a pirate ship outside Puerto Dorado . Additionally, train tracks were added to the area along with a new station, Estación Puerto Dorado.

The Hitman is a role that owners of the R$499 Gamepass can take on. It is a unique job with a maximum of two positions per server. The Hitman hiring "NPC"s can be found behind the Bronze City Saloon and above the The Grizzly Saloon in Howling Peak .

Hitmen are contract killers who focus on tracking down and killing a single player, for a fee. While not always Outlaws, if the Hitman targets any Citizen, they will no longer be on the right side of the law. Hitmen make money upon successful contracts, and make between $100 and $500 per assassination. In addition to cash, Hitmen also gain experience: 3,000 XP for eliminating a player target, and 1,000 XP for taking down an NPC target.

Features [ ]

Abilities [ ]

The Hitman has several special traits related to its role, designed to help facilitate assassinations.

Contracts. The main feature of the job and the gamepass, is that other players can hire the Hitman to kill a user of their choice through the contract menu. The Hitman can only have one contract at a time. Kill Protected Players. Players that the Hitman has been contracted to kill cannot use protection to stay safe, and will lose protection upon being harmed by the Hitman. Track Players. Players that the Hitman has been contracted to kill will show their appearance and last known Location at the top right of the Hitman's screen, which updates every 30 seconds. Spectating. The player who hired the Hitman can watch through the Hitman's point of view while their contract is active.

Other [ ]

The gamepass also comes with some non-role related perks.

Two new Suits . When not employed as Hitman, players who own this pass can wear the Hitman's wrinkled suit, and also gain access to a more modern suit with a thin red tie. Silenced Hammerless Revolver , unlocked at level 10 of the Hitman skill tree. 1886 Lebel Maxim , unlocked at level 40 of the Hitman skill tree.

Mechanics [ ]

The Hitman can ask users "Is there anyone you want dead?" with an [E] prompt. Users can also solicit their services with the "Hire" [E] prompt. Should either party accept, the Hitman menu pops up, allowing the user hiring the Hitman to view a list of every player in the server, and their general location. Outlaws and players with jobs can be targeted for $100 or more. Citizens and the Mayor have higher amounts to target. Players may enter in a custom amount, the minimum being $100 and the maximum being $500. The Hitman will receive 75% of the fee upon successful completion of the hit .

Targeting a Citizen or Mayor results in a $70 bounty on the Hitman, and the "Hitman" crime added to their list of crimes in Auburn Hall .

Contracts are completed when the target is killed by the Hitman . Contracts will fail if the target resets, leaves the server, or if the kill is attributed to anything other than the Hitman. The contract also fails if the Hitman dies, leaves the role, leaves the game, or resets.

The Player who placed the Contract may click "Spectate Hitman" to watch the Hitman's Screen. They can stop spectating by clicking "Stop Spectating". The hitman will see the words "You are being spectated" at the top left of their screen if they are being spectated.

Changes [ ]

Previous [ ]

Jobs were added in Version 2.0, including the Hitman Gamepass. The v2.0.1 patch is known as the Hitman Buff, as the primary balancing changes made in the update included:

Addition of the spectate function Last known location function added, updates every 30 seconds "No available targets" error message if there are no users who can have a hit placed on them Cooldown between hits reduced from 300 seconds to 60 Ability to target Citizens and Lawmen, originally only outlaws and players with jobs could be targeted Hitman tag changed from black to red

In v2.0.2, further changes were made:

Hitmen no longer gain bounty or the assault crime for shooting their target Second Hitman outfit added The Hitman can customize their outfits

Sometime after this, the Hitman lost the ability to customize their outfits, and were locked to the original suit. The suit also lost the gloves. Sometime after version 3.1, the Hitman always has a light skin tone on the hands, regardless of tone selected.

Upcoming [ ]

The Hitman has been teased at having an upcoming revamp, along with other Gamepasses. The exact nature of the revamp is unknown, however is confirmed to include the Silenced Hammerless Revolver and a new Bolt Action Sniper, very similar to the 1886 Lebel Rifle . One promotional render of the Hitman has been released, and used as a phone wallpaper, gamepass icon in the developer build, a whole trailer in the Discord, and as part of a Discord server logo.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

The Hitman is the only Job which doesn't have special role items for slots 7 and 8. Due to being the only way to force players out of protection, Hitmen are commonly hired to take out the Mayor . Accepting hits on Sheriffs , Barkeeps , and Doctors do not give any bounty, nor do they require the $300 necessary for killing normal Citizens or Lawmen. The Hitman NPCs wears the old suit of the Hitman role. The Hitman is the only Job to not be lost with a team change. The Hitman is the only Job to not be lost when a Bounty is gained. The Hitman is the only Job that once purchased will give the player an exclusive outfit. The Hitman is referred to as Ned in the Hitman Trailer as seen above his head. On 09/05/2025, the gamepass price increased from 400 to 499 Robux.

1 Horse Riding 2 Horse Information 3 Obtaining 4 Customization 5 Gallery 6 Trivia

Horse Riding [ ]

All horses share a similar set of gameplay rules, and are spawned, control, and move in the same ways.

Your horses can be viewed, called, and uncalled with the Horse GUI menu, found by pressing H. Players cannot request duels , hits , or purchases while riding horses. Players can request to ride another player's horse by holding E when prompted, and will sit behind the saddle. This makes for a convenient way to stay with a friend while traveling, and can be used as a "gunner" seat. Horse Ramming is a melee attack that can be executed while controlling a horse. Ramming into a player while sprinting will deal 20 damage and will ragdoll the target, the assailant, and the horse. Horse Rams do not affect animals. Horse Stamina is measured by Spur Icons in the central bottom of the screen, above the player's health bar. Using a spur by hitting shift will cause one horse stamina to be consumed, attempting to sprint with no remaining spurs will result in a red flash, the screen shaking, and the horse sprinting, while making annoyed noises. If a second attempt is made before any horse stamina regenerates, the horse will fall over, dead, and ragdoll the rider(s). Horses stand up shortly after death, ready to go back to riding, no matter how many bullets, blades, explosions, falls, or sprints they've taken. Horses take an additional 2x damage on headshots, on top of headshot damage. Almost every gun can kill a horse in one or two headshots. Uncalling a horse that has fallen in combat will result in all horses being unable to be called for up to 15 seconds, depending on the time between it being killed and uncalled. While on horseback, gun accuracy decreases, leaving Throwables and Bows a better option for horseback combat.

Horse Information [ ]

Horse information is measured in statistics and stars. The star scale goes from 1 star to 3 stars, 3 being the best, but also the most difficult to obtain horses, which naturally have the highest statistics. The less stars a horse has, the lower the statistics and price will be.

Horses have three major statistics:

Obtaining [ ]

Horses can be purchased at Joe's Stables and Horses , or any other Stable . Stables can be found in Bronze City , Puerto Dorado , Outlaw's Perch , Windmill Camp , and the Plantation . Delores' Ranch , now located on the Plantation, is the only place where the four 3 star horses can be purchased.

Certain horses could also be obtained during Events .

Customization [ ]

Horses have a few small customization options, including size, eye color, name, and voice pitch for the horse itself, and purchasable blankets, saddles, and recolorable bridles for decoration. Some saddles and blankets have clipping issues, but the majority can be matched in any way.

Horse names are not visible to other players. Blankets and saddles cannot be recolored. Horses currently do not have different patterns available, each breed looking the same as any other horse of the same type, though they can be distinguished by size and eye color. It is unknown if alternate fur and skin patterns will be available in the future, though it is a feature often requested.

The Customization menu can be accessed by heading to any Stable , talking to the stablehand, clicking "My Horses", which will be above the Shop UI, and then selecting the Customize option.

The developers can scale their horses to be smaller or larger than the game normally allows. These horses can also have a higher- or lower-pitched voice than normal gameplay would allow.

Trivia [ ]

Originally, horses had to be tamed after purchase, though the developers removed this, feeling that purchasing a horse was challenging enough. Horses were able to pull the 2019 Sled , and a similar mechanic may be used when Wagons are added. Up to four players can be transported with one horse if both riders have snared one player each with lassos . Skeleton Horse enemy animals could be fought in the Forest of Bones event . Three Horses are not technically horses. The Mule is an infertile hybrid of a horse and donkey. The Reindeer has antlers and a glowing red nose, but bears little resemblance to the Deer found in the forests. It is essentially a horse with antlers and a red nose. The Wendigo Horse possesses glowing red eyes, a Wendigo mask, and visually appears with its chest split open. Despite there being a mule, there are no donkeys that can be found or bought in-game. Event horses and the Mule have special customization menus, with different and restricted options. The developers plan to add more horses. There are 24 total horses in-game: 21 normal horses and 3 Event horses, all of which cannot be Traded . Developer Tamara_X has hinted at adding undead or steampunk horses in the past. A car can be found in Callahan's Ruined Manor , though developers have stated that it is unlikely that motor cars will be seen, at least not until after Wagons . The prices for the 5 star horses have been increased from $10,000 to $30,000 in the Progression Update (4.0) .

It fires much faster than the Longbow , but at the cost of lower damage to the body and head. The Horse Bow is on the more expensive end of shop items, coming in at $8,000. It is highly accurate, deals high damage, and its Aim is not affected by horseback accuracy, as the name and description imply.

Like all other Bows, when an arrow hits its target, they take 20 damage over time due to the Bleeding status effect . If a Bandage is used, this effect can be canceled. This means that if a target is hit with a fully charged headshot, the bleed damage should be enough to kill them.

1 Pros: 2 Cons: 3 Mechanics 4 Changelog 5 Gallery 6 Trivia

Pros: [ ]

Fast fire rate Quiet projectiles High headshot damage Damage and range increase when charged No damage drop-off Not affected by horseback accuracy Compatible with Poison Arrows and Explosive Arrows ; can kill in one hit when using these arrow types Inflicts Bleed status effect on hit

Cons: [ ]

Expensive for a non-Auction item Cannot sprint when charging an arrow Slow projectile velocity Accuracy lowers when charged for too long

Mechanics [ ]

The Horse Bow barely needs to be charged before firing, and can be fired after roughly 0.6 seconds. To reach maximum damage and range, the arrow must be charged for 1.12 seconds.

Accuracy depletes after the indicators start moving again after meeting in the middle of the reticle. As the indicators move towards the center, every shot has near perfect accuracy. Damage starts at dealing 31 for a minimum charge body shot, and 61 for a minimum charge headshot. Damage increases the closer the indicators get to the center, and lock at maximum after reaching the center, even after they pull apart.

Once the indicators reach the center, a body shot will deal 49 damage, while a headshot will deal 98 damage. The player has a very short window to fire the arrow with maximum damage and accuracy, as when the indicators begin moving again, accuracy will fluctuate. Damage will remain at maximum value while drawn.

When using Poison Arrows, no changes are made to the Horse Bow's mechanics, aside from gaining the Poisoned debuff. Poison lasts for sixty seconds, during which the effected player will take 25 damage at a steady rate over time, and will be unable to regenerate health and stamina; even if healing buffs are used.

When using Explosive Arrows, a few changes are made to the Horse Bow's mechanics. Explosive Arrows take longer to fire, and have far less range. They also take longer to reach maximum charge, and overcharging is quite dangerous, as the fuse on the arrow lights as soon as it is drawn. Explosive Arrows work like normal arrows, though arc heavier due to the Dynamite strapped to the head, allowing them to act as "stickybombs".

23/05/2021: The Horse Bow can now use Explosive and Poison arrows.

Trivia [ ]

Prior to Version 3.4 , the Longbow shot smaller, blockier arrows than the Horse Bow; however, this was changed so that both bows use the larger arrows. The Horse Bow was added alongside the Mule Shotgun and Harmonica Rifle in Version 2.0 . The Horse Bow is one of five bows in-game , and can only be purchased at Hunt and Trade . Players can ragdoll while using the Horse Bow. The Horse Bow was first teased on August 20th, 2019.

If a Horse moves fast enough, generally while galloping, it gains an extended hitbox which acts as an attack. Players struck by the Horse will take 20 damage and be thrown into a ragdolled state. The Horse will also trip over the player it hits, throwing off the rider.

NPCs and Horse Ramming [ ]

Early NPCs such as Big Jimmy , Skeletons , and Evil Snowmen were not able to be Horse Rammed, completely ignoring the attack. In some circumstances, this could result in the horse stalling or being tripped. The NPCs added with Undead Legends can be Horse Rammed, however it acts differently compared to ramming a Player. A rammed NPC will take 20 damage, but will not be flung or ragdolled. The horse and rider will not be tripped. Typically, NPCs will immediately attack in retaliation as they are rammed. NPCs who use melee attacks or have a melee weapon equipped will make a direct hit on the rider instantly. NPCs using ranged weapons may retaliate, but are less likely to hit the moving target.

Changelog [ ]

??/??/????: Horse ramming added.

31/10/2020: Horse ramming places the rider into PvP. Prior to this, players could ram in towns without losing their protection.

08/01/2022: Horse ramming now ragdolls the horse and rider, as well as the target.

20/11/2023: Horse ramming now works against NPCs, dealing 20 damage. NPCs are not ragdolled or thrown, and can attack back when rammed.

Trivia [ ]

Before the 2020 Halloween event , horse ramming would not put players into combat. This meant citizens and lawmen could deal damage to Outlaws while keeping their protected status, and could not be harmed. Before the Christmas 2021 (Frozen Days) Revert , horse ramming did not ragdoll the user. A very common technique was to ram a player, and then arrest them before they could stand up, or shoot them with a shotgun, sniper, or fanned gun while they were stunned, effectively killing them instantly with no way to counter the attack. Skeleton Horses attacked with Horse rams during the Forest of Bones Event , dealing 30 damage instead of the normal Horses' 20. Prior to the Frozen Days Revert, Horses such as the Hungarian Halfbred (size) and American Standardbred (health) were some of the best horses for ramming. Smaller and weaker Horses didn't do as well, due to being easier to kill or dodge. Friendly and non-hostile players can still trip horses and their riders without getting ragdolled themselves.


--- Horses_GUI ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 3.9.3 .

The Horses menu can be accessed by pressing H or clicking the Horse icon.

It displays a player's owned horses in order of when they obtained them. Players can spawn their horse by pressing "Call". If they want to despawn their horse, they can press "Uncall" or walk up to ther horse and hold F.

Trivia [ ]

If a player's horse is injured but hasn't fallen down yet, they can open the Horses menu and uncall and then call their horse to bring it back to full health. After customizing a horse that is currently spawned in, players must uncall and then recall their horse to have the changes displayed. A new Horses icon has been teased. If players attempt to uncall and call their horse after it has died, they will be met with a 14 second cooldown timer.

Hotbar

Information

Description

The Hotbar is a GUI located at the bottom of the player's screen, showing up to 8 equipped items . There are six slots available, with an additional two for Jobs . Each slot is numbered.

Slot 1 is for Primaries , such as Rifles and Bows. It is twice as long as the other slots. Slots 2 and 3 are for Sidearms , consisting of most of the pistols and revolvers in game. Slots 4 through 6 are for Tools, Instruments Camping Items , Melee weapons , the Lasso , and Healing Items . Slots 7 and 8 are available when playing as a Mayor , Doctor , Sheriff , or Barkeep , and are locked to roleplay items.

Using the Backpack , players can equip items into slots 1 through 6. To use the items, players hit the corresponding number key to equip or, in the case of Bandages , use items. Loot can not be equipped. Some items can be placed in the hotbar and used without being equipped, like the Lantern . Most items in the hotbar will render on the players' backs and legs, though Camping Items , the Firework Launcher , Navy Revolver , Candy Cane , and a few other select tools will not appear. This can be disabled in the in game settings menu, and used to provide an advantage when equipping weapons, though this has since been fixed. The Weapon Wheel can be used to swap between items in the Hotbar.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

When empty, a Lever Action Rifle similar to a Winchester can be seen in Slot 1. When empty, a revolver similar to a Peacekeeper can be seen in slots 2 and 3, facing the opposite direction that equipped sidearms face. Roleplay items have a special hotbar design, with a purple background. Every item in the hotbar is a three dimensional model, and can be rotated by hovering over it with the cursor. Before the Easter Update, players could equip two primaries, and players had 7 slots instead of 6. Before the game released, no Hotbar or Backpack existed, instead using a weapon wheel.

1.1 I'm on Mac, what about me?

2.1 RBLX FPS Unlocker 2.2 TWW Settings 2.3 ROBLOX Settings 2.4 Device Settings 2.5 Other

Summary [ ]

The Wild West is a giant, complex game, especially in comparison to most games on the ROBLOX platform. It includes many moving objects such as animals, weather, foliage and trees, players and most importantly the sprawling and giant map itself, all of this added up can cause some computers to struggle. This page will show all the solutions to low fps and how you can fix it!

I'm on Mac, what about me? [ ]

Unfortuantely RBLX FPS Unlocker is not compatible with Mac, this page is directed primarily towards windows users, although some tips will still apply.

How to boost your FPS! [ ]

Before we get into the nitty gritty you should know that just like any large, open world game such as Grand Theft Auto, or Red Dead Redemption, if you have a low end PC, or a PC not designed for gaming, and none of these tips help, you may need an upgrade.

Tip: Press Shift + F5 In game to see your FPS.

RBLX FPS Unlocker [ ]

Firstly and most importantly we highly suggest downloading Roblox FPS Unlocker! ROBLOX caps all players’ framerate at 60 frames per second, downloading this will remove this limit, allowing for higher framerates, keep in mind if you don't get over 60fps already this won't help.

Download Here

First, press the 'Download Here' button, you should always go for 64-bit, although if you're computer is 32-bit choose that. Extract the file and launch the .exe file. You've succesfully downloaded RBLX FPS Unlocker!

But , this program will not automatically start whenever you open your computer, to fix this you'll want to make RLBX FPS Unlocker open on startup:

Find where you download the rblxfpsunlocker.exe file, right click on it and cut it. Click on your taskbars search bar and type in run , press enter. Type in shell:startup , press enter. Right click in the folder and press paste.

All done! You've successfully uncapped your ROBLOX FPS!

TWW Settings [ ]

One of the best ways to improve your performance in The Wild West is by turning off shadows, foliage, and rain. All of this and more can be done in the in-game settings, press the cog icon on the top left of your screen to find it.

400.486x400.486px

For ultimate performance;

Disable Windmills - Small Performance Increase Turn Shadows off - Large Performance Increase Turn Foliage Sway and Foliage Physics off - Large Performance Increase Set Show Bullet Trails to off - Small Performance Increase Turn Items Visible on Back off - Small Performance Increase Set Overall Graphic Quality to low (this setting decreases your render distance) - Large Performance Increase Turn Rain Intensity to Off - Medium Performance Increase

ROBLOX Settings [ ]

A great way to improve performance on The Wild West is by reducing graphics quality in ROBLOX's own settings, we recommend going to graphics quality 6, this will decrease shadows, texture quality, and make objects look sharper, while keeping most special effects. If you're desperate for more FPS you can of course decrease the graphics quality further but this will start to eat into your view distance, and may hide some features such as bullet holes and some lighting features.

Keep in mind these settings will apply for all games on ROBLOX.

Device Settings [ ]

If you still aren't comfortable with your performance quality, consider changing the way your device renders the game.

Consider changing your screen's display resolution. This will vary device by device, but if you're on a Windows computer, right-clicking your desktop should allow you to find a "Display Settings" or "Graphics Options" menu, which should allow you to set a custom resolution. Lowering this will make all things run better, however will also make everything more pixelated.

Roblox Graphics Mode. Most computers have a few different ways of rendering 3D objects, and you can pick what runs best with your device. Open ROBLOX Studio, and then go to Settings > Studio Settings > Rendering > Graphics Mode. If your computer has an AMD Graphics card, Vulkan tends to work better, while Intel cards work better with OpenGL.

Other [ ]

Some players have found that playing The Wild West through Windows' Roblox App runs better on their devices. Sometimes, if you use the Roblox App, try downloading and using the Roblox Player (download from ROBLOX Website). Close other bandwidth-using applications while playing The Wild West, such as music streaming services or chat clients. This won't have a big impact on FPS, but it will lower ping and help the game run smoother. With all of these settings combined you will notice a huge leap in performance, especially with the FPS Unlocker and Shadows turned off! And yes, the game will look slightly uglier, so we suggest playing around with it, maybe you're willing to sacrifice a few frames to enable Items Visible on Back for example. Whatever it is make sure to test and see what works best for you! Turning Shadows Off will make caves brighter. You won't need any Lantern on exploring caves!


--- How_to_Report_Exploiters ---

Players on Roblox may occasionally use exploits (also referred to as scripts, cheats, or hacks) to gain an unfair advantage over other players. If you come across a player using exploits, or otherwise violating Roblox's Terms of Use or The Wild West 's Guidelines , don't panic. While exploiters tend to ruin the fun for other users, The Wild West has a fairly strict policy against exploit use, automatically bans users for exploiting, and also takes reports from players about exploiters who slip through the cracks.

What do I need to report a user? [ ]

Evidence [ ]

The first thing you need to report an exploiter is a clear video of their account using the exploits. Any screen recorder should work, as long as it can export clear videos. Roblox has a built-in screen recorder, accessible through the menu. For better quality recordings, consider using external programs, with clipping softwares like Medal or Outplayed , and recording softwares like OBS .

Make sure your recording includes:

The exploiter's username - It has to be legible. You may need to get up close, or have chat and leaderboard enabled. If the exploiter has a Custom Name , make sure you hover over the name so the username can be seen in the video. The exploiting - Get a clear recording of the exploiter using their exploits. Common easily recordable exploits include: Increased rate of fire/increased reload speeds well above the normal limits for any gun Increased accuracy or increased reaction speed for a specific player's aim All glass and/or lights breaking at the same time within the game Player flying (possibly with a horse) or otherwise teleporting around the map Player jump height is abnormally high Shots fired through terrain Players automatically floating between ore deposits All ore near a player instantly being completely mined Rapid and constant avatar changes while performing other activities Instantly escaping lassoes Summoning mass amounts of tumbleweed Abnormal animations/body movements

Video Resources [ ]

Various video documentation of exploiting in The Wild West to illustrate reportable actions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfaaestcq1c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ch_1xmiXPA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2ocHfwPmk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtJ4accX-GM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqORP00mT3k&t=11s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txDHXijREy0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZtQtBTSS-o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfIOx0XraU

Stay safe when browsing for content about hackers, because sometimes people script, fake, or lie about the legitimacy of their report.

If reporting a user for scamming, make sure that the trade in which they scam is recorded from the perspective of the victim. The trading UI will show the scammer's name, and the items. How the trade is a scam, and surrounding context, should be included, either from screenshots or recordings of DMs arranging the trade, or of the in-game chat leading up to, during, or immediately following the trade.

Always record your trades, because you can be scammed at any time, even if you trust the person.

If reporting a user for something else that occurs in-game, make sure you include evidence of the reported activity, and their username. This may include inappropriate conduct, hate speech, or inappropriate user content (Faction name, Custom name, Faction tag, Faction icon, offensive avatars, etc.) If reporting a faction, include at least one username of a player currently in that faction, and proof that they are in it. Players may leave factions, so multiple usernames is the safest way to report.

Video formatting for reports [ ]

Once you have your video proof and the usernames, make sure that your evidence is in a format that the moderators will be able to access. Roblox's built-in recorder tends to output .mkv or .wmv files. These have high compression and distortion, and may not be useable as evidence. Thankfully, uploading them directly to YouTube, or similar video hosting sites, will keep or upscale their quality, and allow them to be shared as valid evidence. .mp4 or other embeddable formats may be sent directly, however if over 25MB in size, they may need to be uploaded to another site first.

Discord [ ]

Join the Discord server to gain access to the #report-users channel. You may need to use /verify in #verify to connect your Roblox and Discord accounts through Bloxlink first.

In one message in #report-users, post:

Your video, either as an embeddable file, or as a link (NOT as a .mkv or .wmv) The reported user's Roblox username as text (Profile link is not needed, make sure that it is the username, and not a custom name or a display name) A brief description of what exploits they used, or a description of why you are reporting them (If the video is long, include timestamps of notable cheating here)

Once finished, send your message.

Congratulations, you have reported your exploiter.

Frequently Asked Questions [ ]

Do you ban people for bypassing the Roblox chat filter? [ ]

Yes, we moderate players for excessive bypassing of the Roblox chat filter, such as spamming the chat with profanities, severe targeted harassment, etc. We don't moderate users for comments such as "ez". If you feel a specific user is harassing you, we recommend that you take your own action and block that user so they cannot chat with you any further.

Can I appeal my ban? [ ]

Suspension and banning decisions are permanent, non-negotiable, and cannot be removed by human reviewers. If you are banned it is because we have detected and have more then enough logs to prove you were exploiting or bypassing the chat filter. Trade restrictions cannot be removed, even after a suspension ends. If you believe that you were falsely banned, you can make an appeal through the dedicated Appeals server, which can be found through the #info channel of the main Discord server. Note that if a ban or punishment is found to have been correctly issued, it will not be appealed.

I don't see any messages in #report-users, is it broken? [ ]

No, message history is disabled for user safety. If you report someone, they won't easily be able to tell it was you.

Can I get back my lost or stolen items? [ ]

No, items lost while your account is hacked cannot be recovered, and will not be compensated for. Items lost in scams will almost never be recovered either, and will not be reimbursed. If a trade has too many steps or seems sketchy, don't make the trade.

I haven't heard back about my report, did anything happen? [ ]

Note that reports have to be manually checked, and may build up or back up, especially around updates, holidays, and weekends. Typically, you will not be contacted about your report. Make sure you include valid evidence and follow any report guidelines.

I don't have Discord, can I report users in-game? [ ]

The in-game report feature has been currently disabled and does not work.

2.6.1 MIDIs With Many Fast Notes 2.6.2 Making MIDIs Sound the Best In-Game

All you really need to know in regards to The Wild West is that MIDI files are basically instructions that get read by the game and played in the necessary way. The game goes through the file and plays the note instructions in the sound font of the instrument you are playing it on. For example, this would mean if you're playing on an Accordion it would play the note at the correct pitch, and use the Accordion sounds to make it actually sound like an Accordion.

The following is a tutorial outlining all the steps from understanding where to get MIDIs to playing them with your friends in-game! Make sure you read closely to ensure you don't miss a critical detail that could prevent you from succeeding.

Watch the video!

Or read here:

Step 1: Locate a Midi [ ]

You could get a MIDI file through many means, but what The Wild West needs to be able to play it is a direct public link to the file itself. In layman's terms, the download link to the file. You'll know if you have the right link if the link ends with ".midi" or ".mid" because those are the MIDI file extensions (it might also have a "/" at the very end - ignore that).

For example, the link should look something like this (these don't actually work):" https://example.com/song.mid " or " https://example.com/music.midi "

Most people will likely want to search for a song they want to play and play that. There are plenty of websites that host links to MIDI files but you aren't just limited to those! You can upload your own MIDIs to the internet and copy the direct link to them from there.

Here are some examples of sites that offer free MIDIs:

https://bitmidi.com https://www.8notes.com https://www.midiworld.com https://onlinesequencer.net (Some Online Sequencer midis do not function, so use caution.) https://thewildwestmidis.github.io - Directly copy MIDI Data with a button. Search, set favorites, upload and preview midis. https://tww-midi.netlify.app/ - Categorized midis.

In this tutorial, the images are used from BitMidi.

Step 2: Get a MIDI [ ]

Copying a file from BitMidi.

If you have the direct file somewhere uploaded to the internet, copy the link.

If you're using a website to find MIDIs, the experience will differ depending on what website you go to. It should be mostly the same though - look for the button or link to download the file itself. Once that has been located, right-click on it and select "Copy link address" to get the link.

Step 3: Open the Band Sync Menu [ ]

Band icon in virtual piano interface.

Now go into The Wild West and start using your Virtual Piano instrument of choice. At the bottom of the screen near the keyboard, click on the blue "Band" button. This will open the Band Sync UI.

Step 4: Enter in the MIDI Data [ ]

Midi data paste.

Once the Band Sync UI is open, simply paste the link you copied into the MIDI Data box. If it worked, you shouldn't get an invalid MIDI data error.

If you did, re-follow the steps above and if that still doesn't work, try a different MIDI. If you're using a site not recommended earlier in the tutorial, double check that the site does indeed offer valid MIDI links. If it wasn't already obvious, don't download any shady files!

Step 5: Making a Band (Optional) [ ]

Band menu.

Now, if you'd like, you can stand next to your friends and add them to your band ! Make sure they're ready with their instrument before you click play! You'll know if they're ready if the icon next to their name is green. Players in bands can play solos, as well as automatically play with the group. Band leaders can kick members and make them the leader.

The Wild West MIDI Positive Practices [ ]

There are some things you should keep in mind when utilizing MIDIs in The Wild West. They range from important to a nice thing to do.

MIDIs With Many Fast Notes [ ]

It's no secret that playing these, especially with multiple people, can really start to lag out the server, most notably to those around the band. It might be worth noting that the people around you might not appreciate the server lag, so you might want to hold off on the very fast MIDIs. Fast MIDIs may also trigger the "You're playing too fast!" error, which will lag your game, and skip notes.

Making MIDIs Sound the Best In-Game [ ]

Something not mentioned in the first section of this page was that MIDIs also contain the instructions of more than one instruments to play as well as what notes to play on those instruments. As the MIDIs in The Wild West are only played on a singular instrument, the game reads all notes in the MIDI file as if they should be played like any other normal note, on the singular instrument you are playing on. Stick to MIDIs with less than five instrument parts, if possible, and avoid vocals.

This might not sound like an issue until percussion comes to mind. Generally, the way percussion is handled in MIDIs is that each note is a "hit" on a certain percussion instrument and thus it doesn't follow normal notes like a piano would, but is still computed on a piano. This means that when The Wild West reads the MIDI file, it interprets the seemingly random notes (that are actually very specific percussion notes) as normal notes that should be played. This results in random tones being played in the song in the place of percussion. Not ideal!

Due to this glaring issue, it's smart to avoid songs with percussion in them in The Wild West. If you really want to play a certain song and it has percussion, investigate some software that allows you to import MIDI files, edit them, and export them as a new MIDI file. With that, you can edit out any percussion, upload the file, grab the link, and play your custom edited MIDI in-game with no percussion issues!

Note that MIDIs with vocal tracks also do not work, as rendering human speech in a MIDI takes a lot more data, tracks, and speed than Roblox can handle.


--- Howling_Peak ---

This article could contain outdated information that is inaccurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game. It was last updated for 4.0 .

Howling Peak Aerial view of the settlement Type Town Location Whispering Summit Inhabitants Auctioneer, General Store merchant, Gun Store merchant, Hitman recruiter Howling Peak is a town in The Wild West, located on Whispering Summit . It used to be one of the least frequented locations, largely owing to its secluded position. Additionally, the town itself is too small for duels and most other combat. However, with the introduction of the Auction House, there's almost always someone hanging around, hoping to pick up a fancy new gun or instrument.

Howling Peak

Location

Inhabitants

Its Sawmill and proximity to Fort Spencer makes it an excellent location to prepare a raid. The town is situated close to several Bear spawns and Ore deposits , making for an easy source of income as a hunter or miner, but loot must be sold outside of the town.

1.2.1 General Store 1.2.2 The Grizzly Saloon 1.2.3 Auction House 1.2.4 Guns and Ammo 1.2.5 Sawmill 1.2.6 Empty Buildings

Description [ ]

Exterior [ ]

This settlement's large stone walls cause it to resemble a Fort when viewed from the outside. Inside a cavity in the southern wall lies a set of thick wooden doors, the main entrance to the town. An alternate northern entrance is found at the back of the Auction House.

Nearby Structures [ ]

Outside of the walled area lie some tents and shacks, with a few boardwalks connecting them together. The shacks are built in the same style and use the same materials as the buildings within the walls. They are mainly empty, although a few hold some crates.

Interior [ ]

Inside the walls lay several dilapidated wooden structures, surrounding a small courtyard with a bonfire. The buildings either look to be in a state of disrepair or neglect, or they were built without an architect on site. Some planks leave gaps in the walls of the buildings and use different wood types. Tarps or boards are placed over windows or holes in the walls. The shapes of these buildings are wildly different from those found in Bronze City or Puerto Dorado . The buildings house the few services available in Howling Peak.

General Store [ ]

Upon entering Howling Peak, the General Store is the first building on the right. It has two entrances, one to the north and one to the west. The shelves inside have frying pans and rolled-up tents on display, and there are some sacks and barrels scattered around as well. This General Store has no unique wares currently.

The Grizzly Saloon [ ]

The Saloon , named The Grizzly , is in the third building on the left, through the door closest to the gates. It shares this building with the Auction House.

The saloon itself has three stories: the first being the main dining area, the second being a balcony with a few tables surrounding the main area, and the third being the attic with a Hitman post. A staircase at the back of the room allows for easy access to the second floor, and a ladder leads to the attic from there. The attic has several thresholds which lead out to the catwalks.

Auction House [ ]

The Auction House is in the third building on the left. It shares this building with the Saloon and they connected through a small doorway found below the stairs. It can be entered from the outside of the settlement or from the courtyard.

The room is filled with exotic cloths and jars, and has several couches facing an Auctioneer in the front. There are also several display cases containing exotic weapons, such as the Spitfire , Schwarzlose , Guycot Chain Rifle and Pistol , and Paterson Six . A Wendigo skull above the auctioneer seemingly gazes down upon players walking below.

Guns and Ammo [ ]

Guns and Ammo is in the second building to the left. It has a few fox and racoon pelts on the walls. No exclusive guns or items are sold here, unfortunately.

The building was previously in the space now occupied by the Auction House. Before it was moved, it had shelves with weapons like Tomahawks , a Mule Shotgun , a Sharps Rifle , and what appeared to be boxes of ammo.

Sawmill [ ]

The Sawmill is found in the first building on the left. There's a passage to a vacant snowy space from one of the exits to the Sawmill building. This space has a ladder leading into an empty nook under the ground. This Sawmill makes Howling Peak a great place to prepare a Fort raid.

Empty Buildings [ ]

Several buildings or areas within Howling Peak are empty. These include most of the exterior structures, the interiors of most of the towers, and the small ladder hollow mentioned previously.

Things to Do [ ]

Although Howling Peak doesn't have too much to do besides watching or bidding on auction items, there's plenty to do outside of them. A Bear spawn can be found extremely close to the town, which easily makes it one of the best places to grind money. Additionally, two more Bear spawns can be found in Bear Paw Valley , and can easily be sniped from the mountain or one of the wrecked train cars.

Valuable ores are also found in relatively close proximity to Howling Peak. Several Silver Nodes and Gold Nodes can be found at the mountain's summit and in the ice ravines found on the north face of the mountain, as well as a few to the east of the town.

Fort Spencer is but a quick journey by horse away. The distance between Howling Peak and Fort Spencer makes it a great location to conduct raids on the Fort , as well as a good spot to spawn if you are waiting to respawn in Spencer.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

You can hide in the snow on the roofs of some of the buildings, which could make for a good hiding spot or sniping spot. This is currently the only location that the player needs to manually discover to spawn at. Howling Peak is the only town without a Stable . Howling Peak might have originally called Bronze Peak during its development, and is called that on the sign at the Junction . Howling Peak is situated directly on top of Dead Man's Drop . Some people have theorized that the ground on which Howling is built may eventually collapse into the Drop. Usually, items and loot cannot be sold at any of the stores in Howling Peak. In the 4.0 update, players can now sell Items and loot in Howling Peak.


--- Howling_PeakHistory ---

Howling Peak was released on 7th April 2020 together with the 2020 Egg Hunt Event , and was the first location ever added that required the player to discover it before being able to spawn at it.

Initially, the town was not very popular, as it had nothing special to distinguish it from other cities. This would change with the 3.1 Factions & Woodcutting update, as the town received a sawmill and is the closest spawn to Fort Spencer , making it a good spawn location for players attempting to take over the fort. On 8th May 2021 the Auction House update was released, which added the Auction House to Howling Peak, replacing its old Gun Store . This would further boost Howling Peak in popularity, as the Auction House is a unique shop that can only be found there.

Whispering Summit Ice Ravines The winding ravines. Type Unnamed Sublocation Location Whispering Summit Inhabitants Bear(s) Having no official name, these canyons are located on the north face of Whispering Summit . They are referred to as the Ice Ravines , the Howling Peak Cave , the Howling Peak Ravines , Ice Gorge , and many other names by the community and casual players.

Whispering Summit Ice Ravines

Type

Location

Inhabitants

The ravines can be found by heading to the summit and then going northwards, down the summit. Some of the entrances into the canyon system are quite deep, so players need to be careful when navigating around here, as they could take serious fall damage if they make one wrong step.

This system of ravines has many tight paths, but relatively few Ore deposits . There are only 2 Iron deposits and 1 Silver deposit inside the canyons, but there is an additional Iron Deposit and Silver Deposit at the mountain's summit. Whispering Summit's Bear spawns here, and some bears wander for enough to enter, so players need to be careful when navigating the paths.

Trivia [ ]

The Cactice can be found here at the end of one of the small gullies. This is one of the few mining locations in the game without an official name. The number ores got further decreased in the Mining Nerf.

The Hungarian Halfbred is a big horse with a white coat, as well as a matching white mane and tail.

Despite having less health and stamina, the Halfbred's high speed makes it one of the most frequently purchased 3-Star Horses. Its large horse ram hitbox and fast speed make it particularly useful in PVP. Alongside the Tennessee Walking , it shares the title of the largest horse in game.

Prior to the 3.4 Update , this horse had one more unit of health than it does currently, making it a tank of a horse. It had the same stats as the American Standardbred .

Location

Inhabitants

Hunt and Trade is a small cabin located in the northeast area of Tribal Forest , next to the large waterfall and a bridge over to the Highland Plains .

The cabin is a single room building with a small porch and standard windows. There is also a rocking chair on the porch. Inside the main cabin is a bed, table, hanging pelts, a mounted deer head, a bear blanket, a chest, and a brick fireplace. Behind the cabin is a basement that contains a Detonator , a reward for completing Robert John Hudson 's quest .

The basement is also a single room, and is much smaller compared to the cabin above. Large boards line the walls, giving it an unfinished appearance. A workbench on the right holds the Detonator , with a small red toolbox in front of it. Crates are strewn around the room, two of which are empty, and three of which are closed. A support structure holds up the back of the basement, and resembles a caved-in entrance to a mine. Next to the wooden beams are two barrels, likely powder kegs, judging by the color and Hudson's passion for explosives.

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

There are several Instruments available to purchase and play in The Wild West . Most instruments run off of Virtual Piano, with a few exceptions.

5.1 General Store 5.2 Honorary Mentions

Virtual Piano Instruments [ ]

Virtual Piano Instruments can form Bands , play MIDI files , or just use a keyboard full of notes. They all share the same controls and interface. However, they differ in sound font, general manner in which they sound, the sound of playing chords and notes, and availability of notes.

Stationary Pianos [ ]

Pianos are large keyed instruments, and are normally stationary. They can be operated by one user at a time, and often play themselves when not in use, providing atmosphere and charm to specific locations.

Piano [ ]

The first instrument most players will come across, found in Bronze City , Puerto Dorado , and the Outlaw's Perch . Having the full range of the virtual piano, they play an arrangement of "Cow Boy Intermezzo" when not in use. There can only be one player at a time. [Alt] can be pressed to paste in musical notes, as a sheet to view. The piano keyboard will appear at the bottom of the screen, along with a Sustain Slider, Pitch Slider, and options for Caps Lock (Black Keys), view sheet, or the Band and MIDI menu .

Calliope Steam Organ [ ]

Located on the Steamboat , the Calliope is an air-powered organ that is loud and shrill. When not in use, it may play an arrangement of "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee," a song dating back to 1912. Unlike other idle songs in the game, it can be toggled by interacting with the pipes on the floor above the Calliope. The Calliope has the full range and works the same as the piano (both having the Virtual Piano UI), though naturally sustains longer and plays louder. Originally, steam organs worked by forcing steam through train whistles.

Organ [ ]

Located in the Church , this is a pump or reed organ, lacking the external metal piping of a pipe organ.

Harpsichord [ ]

Located in Howling Peak 's Auction House , this piano-like instrument is tucked away behind the stage, and plays "Les Cyclopes". Harpsichords were created in the middle ages, and function very similarly to Pianos; however, the keys pluck strings instead of striking them to create noises. Harpsichords had gone out of style in the 19th century, but had a resurgence in the 20th century.

Auction Instruments [ ]

Most instruments can be obtained at the Auction House . Auction instruments are portable inventory items that use the Virtual Piano system. They are often very expensive, as is nearly everything in the Auction House.

Harmonica [ ]

Originally only found in fort jails, a portable version can be won in the auction house, with a starting bid of $2,000.

Trumpet [ ]

A lively-sounding brass instrument, starting bid is $6,000.

Drum [ ]

Basically a portable Bongo with a far greater note range, starting bid is $2,000.

Guitar [ ]

A community favorite string instrument, starting bid is $10,000.

Flute [ ]

Prior to the 3.4 update, this was a developer-exclusive item and was only given to trusted staff, after being added to Auction starting bid is $4,000.

Fiddle [ ]

A fine-sounding string instrument, starting bid is $8,000.

Accordion [ ]

A Handheld pump-organ instrument, starting bid is $10,000.

Gamepass Instruments [ ]

These instruments can be obtained through purchasing a gamepass.

Banjo (R$200) [ ]

A string instrument with a round open-backed body; makes a plucking sound when played.

Developer Instruments [ ]

Previously, the Flute was Developer-Only . However, with the 3.4 update, it became available to the public, and the Heavy Guitar took its place.

Heavy Guitar [ ]

A reskinned Guitar with a different electric sound, which emits lightning particles when played.

Other Types of Instruments [ ]

These do not feature the Virtual Piano interface.

General Store [ ]

These instruments may be bought at a General Store .

Bongo Drums - Not to be confused with a Drum . This instrument makes very quiet drum noises, and can produce six sounds. Tribal Horn - A horn which produces a low call. Has a 5 second cooldown between blows.

Honorary Mentions [ ]

These "instruments" usually only play one sound.

Mayor's Bell - Bell found at Auburn Hall in Bronze City . Mayor's Whistle - Roleplay item that is used to call for Lawman Protection . Bells - Bells found at Forts Henry and Spencer or onboard the Steamboat . Clapping - An emote. Sitar - A sitar can be found at a memorial in Bear Paw Valley . It cannot be picked up or used.


--- Item_Tiers ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

See Guns & Items for a full list of items with their background/item tiers.

Items in the Backpack , Bank , Mailbox , and the Hotbar have small thumbnail icons representing them. These icons consist of two parts: a rendering of the item model and a background. Item tiers within menus are conveyed through the background of the item.

The item, while appearing to be a static image, is actually a 3D rendering of the item model within a ViewportFrame . The model can be rotated in the Hotbar slots by right-clicking. The background, on the other hand, only displays in Backpack and Bank and is normally a static image, though Developer and Gamepass item backgrounds have color-changing animated gradients applied. These backgrounds generally convey item rarity or value, but this depends on the item.

Below is a complete list of all known background/item tiers:

Characteristics [ ]

Jane is a Demon Hunter who hunts Wendigos. Her partner, Carter , was killed by one. She wears the Demon Hunter outfit and wields an Occult Mule , Peacekeeper Revolver , and Occult Blade .

Behavior [ ]

During the event, Jane wandered around Raider Canyons , The Plantation , Bronze City , Pinewood Hills and the Swamp . She would attempt to eliminate any Undead she came across, including the Skin Walker and Wendigo . Any Wendigo Cultist would be met with the same treatment, as would players wearing the Cultist outfit or the Wendigo Hat. Aliens would also attack her if their paths crossed.

Jane could be talked to, and offered the player advice on where to go during the event. Players who gave her the Wendigo Ribs would be rewarded with the Demon Hunter outfit, as well as the Occult Mule .

Attacking Jane, or approaching her after defeating her in the past, or while wearing Cultist clothing would draw her ire, with Players fulfilling any of these conditions being attacked on sight. Players who successfully defeated her had would be granted one Occult Sawed Off , regardless of if they had one from the year before already or not, as well as the Demon Hunter outfit if it hadn't already been unlocked through bringing her the Wendigo Ribs or killing Carter. On death, she also had a very low chance of dropping her Occult Blade.

--- Jobs ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

The Wild West has an assortment of roles and jobs to play as!

All of these jobs can be found scattered around the towns which dot the world. Jobs and roles are a fun way to experience the Old West.

Upon death, any role will be lost, followed by a cooldown so everyone can have a turn.

Although some jobs may allow you to earn money and may give special perks, they are primarily intended for entertainment and roleplay.

Jobs are split into two categories: Free to Play and Gamepass. Free jobs can be taken on by any player, while Gamepass jobs require you to have a certain Gamepass to become that profession.

It can not be worn while the role is held. Hitmen used to have black gloves, however this was changed, instead giving their hands the lightest skin tone. Characters with darker skin tones will appear to be wearing light colored gloves. The Gamepass costs 499 Robux.

Mayor [ ]

The Mayor role is a valuable Gamepass that comes with exclusive privileges. As a Mayor, you have the ability to interact with various elements within Auburn Hall in Bronze City, including the power to call for assistance and oversee trials. Your position makes you a prime target for Outlaws, while also earning the admiration of Civilians as a symbol of justice. The responsibility of determining who will be incarcerated or granted freedom lies in your hands as the Mayor.

Abilities

Call for Help. Mayors can use their whistle when being hunted by a Hitman or when outside of protected areas to request protection. Players who accepted would have been given the Mayor's location, the Lawman team, and $100 if they stayed in range of the mayor until the timer ran out. The Protection call lasted 100 seconds, or until the mayor was killed or made it to a safe zone. Safe zones and death wouldn't pay the lawmen. There is a 5 minute cooldown between calls. Trials. The Mayor can choose to hold a trial when a Sheriff arrests someone with Handcuffs, when a Menace is captured, or if the arrested Outlaw has a high enough bounty. Trials do not stop Civilians from claiming the bounty, or Outlaws having to pay a fine. The Mayor can decide whether the criminal on trial is guilty or innocent, and whether they get sent to jail or not. Gavel. A roleplay tool used only in trials, Mayors can slam their desk with this. Bounty Board. Mayors can pardon the bounty of any player with a bounty under $150, as listed on the board in their office. This action has a one minute cooldown. Gramophone. Mayors can interact with the gramophone in Auburn Hall to play music. Town Funds, bodyguards, town meetings, and most wanted. Mayors can acquire town funds, which are used to hire NPC bodyguards , call citizens in Bronze City to a town meeting, and double the bounty on an Outlaw with most wanted.

Notes

The Mayor's Suit is a tailed suit, open over red plaid, with dark pants. There can only be one Mayor at a time. There is only one job posting for Mayor, outside of Auburn Hall . The Gamepass costs 1000 Robux. If the Mayor or the defendant gets killed during a trial the defendant automatically gets found guilty and accordingly sent to jail; this is a downside to arresting someone as Mayor.

It is a junction of three train tracks: one track going towards Whispering Summit and Bear Paw Valley, one headed towards Bronze City , and the other going to the Plantation . It was supposedly built by " R. Train ", in reference to the developer RedTrain. Every train passes through the Junction at least once.

In the center of the area stands a B.P.R.R. Section House , next to which is a Sheffield Velocipede Car . There are also three working track switches at the Junction that determine which direction an oncoming train will take.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

A sign at the Junction points towards Bronze City and "Bronze Peak". The latter might have been an early name for Howling Peak before the 2020 Egg Hunt . The "Bronze Peak" track does not actually stop at Howling Peak, instead heading to the Copper Gulch Mine station or exiting the map. The removal of the reference to RedTrain in the area's title and map location took place in Version 3.4 . The signpost continues to call the location "Red's Junction".

The "Bronze Peak" track does not actually stop at Howling Peak, instead heading to the Copper Gulch Mine station or exiting the map.

The signpost continues to call the location "Red's Junction".

In a sneak peak of a new train, a lever can be seen, most likely indicating players can change the direction of the train at the junction. This junction is known as a wye junction, a railroad junction that adjoins three rail lines with a railroad switch. Red's Junction has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) . The B. P. R. R Section House is owned by the Bronze Peak Railroad Company , such as the B. P. R. R. Pump House .

Attempting to wrangle in the local Outlaw population from terrorizing the various innocent citizens is no easy task. As a Lawman, your aim is to quiet those who are starting to develop a big name for themselves through infamy, and prevent crimes from growing too large.

Contents

1 Sheriff 2 Lawmen 3 Arresting 4 Cop NPCs 5 Gallery 6 Trivia

Sheriff [ ]

A Sheriff's purpose is ensuring that Outlaws that wander too close to Bronze City are swiftly dealt with, be it through their trusty Baton and Cuffs or through a simple gunfight. To become a Sheriff, head to the office left of the spawn at Bronze City. Two people can hold the Role of Sheriff per server.

The Sheriff has two special tools to aid them in their journey as a lawman.

Sheriff-only tools:

Sheriffs possess a Baton that they can use to whack Outlaws to the ground, which will ragdoll them for a short time. The Baton is equipped to key 7, and deals 10 damage per hit. Hitting an Outlaw, danger, or duel partner will disable their ability to sprint for an unknown period of time. Hitting a player twice will ragdoll them, allowing them to be killed with ease or arrested with the use of the Handcuffs. Handcuffs can be used to instantly arrest any ragdolled Outlaw or Danger, claiming their alive bounty and giving the Mayor a prompt to hold a trial. The Handcuffs are equipped to key 8.

Lawmen [ ]

The Lawman Emblem

Lawmen are a now mostly-defunct team. The possibility of joining it has been disabled by the developers since they're working on a brand new quests system. It is expected to make a return in a future update.

It used to be accessible by accepting a Justice Quest . There used to be four Justice Quests, three of which could be randomly given by the Quests Menu, the fourth being called for by the Mayor . Manually selecting these quests allowed Citizens to join the Lawmen team, giving them a fancy blue nametag and the ability to see other nearby Lawmen with the logo above their heads. Lawmen quests involved such activities as killing murderers, arresting Outlaws, protecting the Mayor, and recovering stolen goods with rewards ranging between $50 and $100.

Arresting [ ]

In order to get someone's full bounty, you'll need to arrest them alive. Arresting someone will send them in jail for a specific amount of time, depending on their Wanted Level . If the person has over $750 in bounties or has the Menace status, they will be sent to Ashburn Prison Camp . Unmarked Outlaws, as well as Dangers and Killers with less than $750 bounty will be sent to the normal Bronze City jail or the Dorado Jail, depending on where they were arrested. Note that the Mayor (if there is one available) can still determine an Outlaw's fate through trial, though this only applies if they have over $100 in bounty, or were arrested alive by a Sheriff.

The Lasso can be used by any non-Outlaw Player to arrest Outlaws, and claim their alive bounty. To get the alive bounty, the Outlaw must be tied up and arrested for 10 seconds. If they are freed in this time, the Lawman will not receive the full bounty. If freed, the player will receive no reward, and the Outlaw will be free. Whoever freed them will also get a bounty for what we might consider complicity. If killed, the Lawman claims the dead bounty (40% of the alive bounty). If the Outlaw leaves the game while tied up and waiting to be arrested the Lawman will claim the full alive bounty and the Outlaw will be teleported to the jail upon rejoin; if the Outlaw leaves the game after being hit by a civilian, said civilian will claim the Outlaw's dead bounty.

Handcuffs are exclusive to Sheriffs, and can be used to almost instantly teleport Wanted players of any level directly to Jail or Ashburn Prison Camp , claiming alive bounty. Outlaws can be ragdolled by giving them two hits of the baton, knocking them off a horse, killing their horse, falling off a drop, being lassoed but not picked up, or upon failing a Roll .

Outlaws can voluntarily arrest themselves by turning themselves in at the Sheriff's Office and Jail or the Dorado Jail , which will distribute their bounty to all the non-Outlaw players in the server. If their bounty was over $100, the Mayor may hold a trial.

Cop NPCs [ ]

In a teaser, cop NPCs were shown wandering around Bronze City. When an outlaw walked up to them, Wyatt Stetson stated "Your wild ways are over, partner. Best come along quiet." The three cops had a basic loadout of the Winchester , Peacekeeper , and Baton . Wyatt Stetson appears to be a "captain" of sorts, as he was the only who spoke and also blew a whistle . This feature is most likely being added to prevent outlaw camping in the city.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Previously, players could spawn as Lawmen or sign up at the Sheriff's Office. Sheriffs are technically Citizens. The Baton is considered as one of the best weapons in the game, despite the short range, because of its slowing effect and ability to render players immobile. That being said, it is not used often because the Sheriff's position is simply so unpopular and unnoticed that it is usually forgotten. With the addition of Citizens being able to perform arrests, the Lawmen team became obsolete other than for dedicated bounty hunters wishing to use team chat. Curiously enough, there is a Peacekeeper Revolver on the desk of the Sheriff's Office. It is unable to be picked up and used, however. On a wall inside the Sheriff's Office there's a wooden shelf which resembles a gun rack, though it's completely empty. By the Sheriff's Office door there's a bookshelf with some unnamed books. The chimney departing from the stove inside the Sheriff's Office goes out on the roof and has smoke coming out of it. If you manage to escape your cell while you're jailed, you can become any of the Roles including Sheriff .

That being said, it is not used often because the Sheriff's position is simply so unpopular and unnoticed that it is usually forgotten.

--- Kaz_Co_Firearms ---

This article is considered accurate for the current version ( 4.0.1 ) of the game.

Kaz Co. Firearms is a firearm company in The Wild West . The name is a reference to Starboard Studios developer Kazuhira, who modeled many of the guns that the company sells. Kaz Company Firearms produces or distributes unique, rare, and powerful firearms that are sold in the Auction House , and also owns the Gun Store found in Bronze City .

Kaz Co. Firearms crates can be found in several locations, primarily in the Auction House. Another Kaz Co. crate can be found in the Ruined Fort , though it is not known how the crate got there.

The possible founder of Kaz Company, K. Hira, was buried in Dead Man's Rest , whose epitaph read "Went insane attempting to move a mountain." It is unknown if K. Hira actually founded the Kaz Company, but both the company and the grave reference the same developer, Kazuhira.

Ketchum Grenades are an throwable explosive weapon.

They function in a similar manner to Dynamite , but explode upon impact with the first surface it comes in contact with instead of a set fuse time.

Grenades are capable of killing a player in one hit at close range, and probably other animals such as a Bison or a Horse because of their 176 damage displayed in the video.

Trivia [ ]

Grenades are the only weapon that may be capable of dealing decimal amounts of damage, as shown by their damage counter in their reveal video. This may also hint at the addition of decimal damage indicators for all weapons in an upcoming update, and a wider and more specific range of damage amounts in general. A video of the Grenade was released on March 7th, 2022 in the Starboard Studios Discord Server . The Grenade highly resembles the Ketchum and Raines Grenades made in the American Civil War, fitting the time period and other civil war references in the game.

Krampus spawned, and then healed from, four floating ice crystals. These crystals were not difficult to destroy, requiring about two to three shots to break (one shot with a shotgun), and respawned after a short while.

When Krampus was aggressive, the crystals shot out beams of light to him and regenerated his health, similar to the Ender Dragon from Minecraft . The crystals resembled the ones in the 2019 Winter Sale Christmas event 's Totems.

In more extreme versions, instead of being returned home, naughty children are dragged to hell, and then eaten. Krampus originated in Germany, his name is derived from the word for a claw, "Krampen". Krampus would continue to attack players after they ragdolled, unlike Animals or the Wendigo .

Mechanics [ ]

Melee [ ]

It has slower swing and cut rates compared to the Bowie Knife , but the high damage makes up for it with the ability to kill a player in two hits. Similarly to the Bowie Knife, the Kukri Machete has two different attacks, allowing you to perform either an overhead cutting motion or a wide-arching swing motion. However, the latter comes with the downside of not being able to swing as fast using the attack as compared to the overhead cutting motion. Like other melees, the Kukri attacks can clip through terrain, objects, and walls depending on the thickness. Kukri Machetes can also be used while swimming underwater

Variants [ ]

All Kukri Machetes have the same description, mechanics, general appearance, and attributes. Unlike other items with variants (such as the Dragoon Pistol , Tomahawk , Volcanic Pistol , and Volcanic Rifle ), Kukris are strictly recolors, though a glitch during Halloween 2022 did show them as having internal variant numbers following the item name. This may affect the spawn rate of the Kukris on Auction, though the higher rates may also have been a result of being added after the Auction's original rotation. All Kukris share the same sheathed spot on the player, which may lead to visual clipping if more than one is equipped in the same location.

Changelog [ ]

Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format.

11/12/2021: An image of a Kukri was released as a Sneak Peek. The variant shown appears to have been reworked into the "Grey" Kukri, featuring the same colors, the only difference being the blade's colors have been inverted.

25/12/2021: The Kukri Machete was added to the game, with eight color variants.

15/1/2022: Each Kukri Machete variant were given sheaths.

Trivia [ ]

Kukri Machetes have inward swinging motions when left clicking, unlike other knives that have a forward stabbing attack assigned to "Stab." The right click attack is different as well; with a outward slash that covers most of the surrounding area. The Kukri's description is a reference to the game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , where Gaz tells the Player "Remember, switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading." The Kukri is a type of machete from Nepal and India. Traditionally used as a multitool (Digging, clearing foliage and small trees, and chopping meat), it is famous for its use in warfare, notably by the Nepali Army and the Gurkhas. The Kukri Machete is the first melee weapon to be featured on the Auction House, and the first one sold for $3,690,000. The Kukri Machete has a sell price of $28,000 and could once be sold in the Black Market . The Kukri and the Axegonne are the only auction items that were never droppable. Kukris are the only non-sidearm items with sheaths, holsters, or other visible means to carry them, and the only items with unique sheaths. The Mauser 's VIP holster could be argued to be a unique holster, however it can be used by any sidearm while worn.

Mechanics [ ]

Melee [ ]

It has slower swing and cut rates compared to the Bowie Knife , but the high damage makes up for it with the ability to kill a player in two hits. Similarly to the Bowie Knife, the Kukri Machete has two different attacks, allowing you to perform either an overhead cutting motion or a wide-arching swing motion. However, the latter comes with the downside of not being able to swing as fast using the attack as compared to the overhead cutting motion. Like other melees, the Kukri attacks can clip through terrain, objects, and walls depending on the thickness. Kukri Machetes can also be used while swimming underwater

Variants [ ]

All Kukri Machetes have the same description, mechanics, general appearance, and attributes. Unlike other items with variants (such as the Dragoon Pistol , Tomahawk , Volcanic Pistol , and Volcanic Rifle ), Kukris are strictly recolors, though a glitch during Halloween 2022 did show them as having internal variant numbers following the item name. This may affect the spawn rate of the Kukris on Auction, though the higher rates may also have been a result of being added after the Auction's original rotation. All Kukris share the same sheathed spot on the player, which may lead to visual clipping if more than one is equipped in the same location.

11/12/2021: An image of a Kukri was released as a Sneak Peek. The variant shown appears to have been reworked into the "Grey" Kukri, featuring the same colors, the only difference being the blade's colors have been inverted.

25/12/2021: The Kukri Machete was added to the game, with eight color variants.

15/1/2022: Each Kukri Machete variant were given sheaths.

Trivia [ ]

Kukri Machetes have inward swinging motions when left clicking, unlike other knives that have a forward stabbing attack assigned to "Stab." The right click attack is different as well; with a outward slash that covers most of the surrounding area. The Kukri's description is a reference to the game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , where Gaz tells the Player "Remember, switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading." The Kukri is a type of machete from Nepal and India. Traditionally used as a multitool (Digging, clearing foliage and small trees, and chopping meat), it is famous for its use in warfare, notably by the Nepali Army and the Gurkhas. The Kukri Machete is the first melee weapon to be featured on the Auction House, and the first one sold for $3,690,000. The Kukri Machete has a sell price of $28,000 and could once be sold in the Black Market . The Kukri and the Axegonne are the only auction items that were never droppable. Kukris are the only non-sidearm items with sheaths, holsters, or other visible means to carry them, and the only items with unique sheaths. The Mauser 's VIP holster could be argued to be a unique holster, however it can be used by any sidearm while worn.

Description [ ]

Entrances [ ]

There are several entrances; the safest being an entrance found on the south face of Raider Canyons. It is a long hole with a rope ladder . To access the main cave, the player has to swim across the second pool, which houses several Gerald . There are a few other tunnels on the lake bed, however, unless you're okay with being fish food, it's best to take the empty tunnels.

Cave Description [ ]

One of the most open caves in the map, three pools can be found, along with 6 Gerald , and a spacious main room. The main room makes a good campsite, and is connected to two pools. The first pool is at the back of the cave, and is a safe entrance and exit into the lake. The second pool is across from the first pool, and has a low ceiling. This pool has a few underwater nooks, and is full of Gerald , however crossing it leads to a narrow tunnel with a rope up to Raider Canyons .

On the west side of the main room is an open tunnel, from which features the third pond. Following the tunnel will loop around to the third pool, which has less Gerald than the second pool, but is still quite dangerous. There are two tunnels out of this pool, which lead to the lake.

Gallery [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Players often tie up and throw their enemies, friends, and acquaintances to the monstrous fish that live in the pools, making for an easy way to punish intruders. The Steamboat 's route goes straight over the entrance, making it easy to evade the law while robbing the boat by jumping down and exiting via the rope. Over time, more Gerald have been added to the pools. The Lake Cave has been revamped in the Progression Update (4.0) .

The Lancaster Pistol is a quad-barrelled English howdah pistol "used to defend hunters against tigers," and other large wild animals. With multiple barrels, the large bullets, and the break-action design, it may appear similar to a Sawed-Off Shotgun , but it fires with far higher accuracy and velocity.

The Lancaster Pistol fires steadily and deals 50 damage to the body and 90 to the head at point-blank range (within 5 studs from gun barrel to a player's head). Its excellent accuracy makes this Auction-only firearm perfect for hunters looking to show off their cash while still keeping themselves safe.

Special Mechanics [ ]

The Lancaster has the steepest damage drop-off in the game as a trade-off for its very high damage and quick fire-rate, hitting minimum damage even earlier than most shotguns start to drop. Despite the steep drop-off, the lowest possible damage that can be dealt with this pistol is 35 damage on a bodyshot and 63 damage on a headshot. This high amount of damage is enough to kill at any range in three shots. It can one-shot most horses with a headshot at any range. The Lancaster can kill every non-Legendary animal with 4 or fewer headshots. Players killed by a Lancaster bullet tend to be sent flying, similar to the effect of being killed with a shotgun.

Trivia [ ]

Howdah platforms are carriage-like objects placed on an elephant or a camel's back. Howdah guns are large caliber firearms originally used to protect these platforms from predators and big game animals while hunting. Some players, however, shorten the pistol's name into just "Lan" or "Lanc" , although this is informal and does not have any official mention. Lancaster's Howdah pistols were often purchased for personal military use by the British in colonial settings. They had unique oval rifling, allowing a variety of revolver, rifle, and even shotgun cartridges to be fired without fouling. They remained popular amongst British soldiers until World War I. The grip style and external ejectors seen in-game on the Lancaster is indicative of a two-barrel chambered in .577, while in real life, four barrels were typically chambered in .476, with a smooth grip and an internal ejection system. The Lancaster Pistol has a sell price of $21,000 but cannot be sold to any vendor NPCs . Like all other auction items, it used to be droppable. The Lancaster Pistol, the Admiral's Axegonne , and the Kukri Machete are the only weapons that are not displayed inside the Auction House. The Lancaster Pistol was the only original auction weapon not to have a display case in the Auction House . The first Lancaster Pistol was sold at auction for $610,000.

Upon being equipped, the Lantern will hang off the player's hip and produce a small light source . This allows for the usage of other items or weapons while it is active. It can also be manually carried in one's hand.

The Lantern can greatly assist in Hunting or Mining at night or in caves, as the player will have a source of light even when they are performing other tasks. While it appears to have an advantage over the Torch , it still has its ups and downs.

The Lantern was first leaked by Tyridge77 , and was added a few days later in Version 3.2 . If the Items Visible on Back setting has been checked, the Lantern will stop appearing; ergo, no light for the user unless the item is held. The Jack o' Lantern hat from the 2020 Halloween Event produces a similar effect to the Lantern, emitting light in a small radius around the player. However, this hat takes up no inventory slots, allowing you to equip another item in your hotbar rather than equipping the Lantern. The lantern appears unlit in the Backpack icon and in the shop menu.
